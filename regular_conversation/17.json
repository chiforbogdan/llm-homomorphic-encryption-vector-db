Subject: Catching Up!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It's been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to check in.

How have you been? I heard that John Doe recently took a trip to the mountains. I can only imagine how beautiful the scenery must have been! Did he share any fun stories from his adventure?

Also, I was chatting with Michael Snow the other day, and he mentioned he’s been trying out some new recipes. I’ve been on the lookout for some culinary inspiration myself—maybe I should ask him for a few tips!

And how’s Summer Winter doing? I remember she was planning to start a new hobby. Did she end up picking up that painting class she was considering?

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
