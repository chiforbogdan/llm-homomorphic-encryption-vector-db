Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It feels like ages since we last caught up. How have you been? 

I was just thinking about our last conversation and how John Doe was excited about his recent hiking trip. I heard he conquered some impressive trails! Did you get a chance to see any photos he posted?

Also, I ran into Michael Snow the other day. He mentioned he’s been experimenting with some new recipes in the kitchen. Knowing him, I can only imagine the culinary creations he’s whipping up! Have you tried any of his dishes lately?

And how is Summer Winter doing? I remember she was planning a little getaway. I hope she had a fantastic time and is feeling refreshed!

Looking forward to hearing all your updates. Let’s chat soon!

Best,
