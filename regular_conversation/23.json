Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to touch base and see how things are going on your end.

I heard that John Doe recently took up hiking on the weekends. Have you had a chance to join him on any of those adventures? I can only imagine the views! 

I also saw that Michael Snow has been getting into photography lately. I’m curious to see some of his work—he always had an eye for capturing the moment! 

And Summer Winter mentioned the other day that she’s been trying her hand at baking. I’d love to hear about her latest creations. Maybe she could share a recipe or two!

Let me know how you’ve been doing and if you’ve had any fun plans lately. I always enjoy hearing from you!

Take care,  
[Your Name]
