Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to touch base a bit.

How have you been? I heard from John Doe that he recently took a weekend trip to the mountains. I can only imagine how beautiful it must have been this time of year! Have you had a chance to do any traveling lately?

I also saw that Michael Snow picked up a new hobby—photography, I believe. I always knew he had an eye for detail! It would be great to see some of his shots when you get a chance.

And I can't forget about Summer Winter! She mentioned planning a cozy fall gathering soon. It sounds like a perfect way to celebrate the season. Are you planning to join her?

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
