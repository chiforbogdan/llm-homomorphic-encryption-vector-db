Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we caught up, and I thought it would be nice to reach out for some casual chit-chat.

How have you been? I recently ran into John Doe at a coffee shop, and he was telling me about his new hiking adventures. It sounds like he’s been having a blast exploring some beautiful trails! Have you had a chance to catch up with him lately?

I also heard from Michael Snow that he’s taken up cooking again. He mentioned trying out some new recipes that he’s excited about. I can only imagine the delicious meals he’s been whipping up—he always had a knack for that!

And speaking of fun activities, Summer Winter shared that she’s been diving into some new hobbies. I think she mentioned something about painting and trying to get creative during her free time. I’d love to hear more about that!

It’s always great to see everyone pursuing their passions outside of work. Let’s catch up soon—maybe over coffee or lunch? I’d love to hear more about what you’ve been up to as well!

Take care and talk soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
