Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to touch base.

How have things been on your end? I heard that John Doe recently took a trip to the mountains—did he send you any stunning photos? I can only imagine the views he must have encountered! 

Also, I ran into Michael Snow the other day; he was raving about the new café that opened up downtown. Have you been there yet? I’m curious to hear if it lives up to the hype! 

And of course, I can't forget about Summer Winter! I saw her post some amazing baking creations on social media recently. She really has a talent for making everything look so delicious! 

Hope to hear from you soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
