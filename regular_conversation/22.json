Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a line.

How have you been? I heard that John Doe has taken up hiking lately—he must have some incredible stories from the trails! It’s so nice to see him embracing the outdoors. 

Also, I ran into Michael Snow last week. He was telling me about his recent trip to the mountains. He seemed really excited about it, and it made me think about planning a getaway myself. Have you been on any fun trips recently?

And Summer Winter! I can’t believe how quickly the year is flying by. It feels like just yesterday we were celebrating the New Year. I hope she’s been enjoying her time and finding some balance. 

Let me know how you’re doing when you have a moment. It would be great to hear from you!

Take care,

[Your Name]
