Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d reach out to see how things are going on your end. 

I heard that John Doe has taken up gardening as a new hobby. I can only imagine how green his thumbs must be getting! Have you had a chance to chat with him about it? 

Also, I saw that Michael Snow recently went on that hiking trip he was planning. I bet he has some stunning photos to share! I’ve been meaning to ask him about the trails he explored. 

And how’s Summer Winter doing? I remember she was excited about her recent travel plans. I hope she had a fantastic time wherever she went!

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
