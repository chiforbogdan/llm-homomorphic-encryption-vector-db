Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to reach out and say hello.

How have you been? I heard that John Doe recently took up hiking on the weekends. I can only imagine the views he must be enjoying! I also remember Michael Snow mentioning he was trying out a new recipe for homemade pizza. I’d love to get the scoop on how that turned out—did he manage to make it a success? And Summer Winter was telling me about her recent travels. She always has the best stories; I can’t wait to hear more about her latest adventure!

Things on my end have been pretty good. Just enjoying the little things and trying to stay busy with hobbies outside of work. 

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
