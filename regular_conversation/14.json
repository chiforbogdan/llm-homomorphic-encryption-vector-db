Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a line to see how things are going on your end.

I heard from John Doe recently—he mentioned he’s taken up gardening as a new hobby. I can’t imagine him with a green thumb, but he seemed pretty excited about it! Have you had a chance to chat with him lately?

Also, I ran into Michael Snow last week. He was raving about a new restaurant that just opened up downtown. Apparently, they have the best tacos in town! I’m definitely going to check it out soon. Have you been to any good places lately?

And how’s Summer Winter doing? I remember she was planning a trip to the mountains this fall. I hope she’s having a great time and enjoying the beautiful autumn colors!

Anyway, just wanted to say hi and see what you’ve been up to. Looking forward to hearing back from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
