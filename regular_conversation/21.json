Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It's been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to check in.

How have you been? I heard from John Doe that he recently took up gardening as a new hobby. Can you believe it? He always said he didn’t have a green thumb! I’m curious to see how his plants are doing. 

Also, I ran into Michael Snow the other day. He mentioned he’s planning a trip to the mountains this winter. I can only imagine how beautiful it must be up there with all the snow. Have you ever been during that time of year? 

And of course, there’s Summer Winter! I can't believe it's already fall; she must be busy prepping for her annual fall festival. I remember last year’s event was such a hit! 

Anyway, I’d love to hear what you’ve been up to lately. Let’s catch up soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
