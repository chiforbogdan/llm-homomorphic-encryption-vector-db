Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It feels like ages since we last caught up. How have you been?

I was just chatting with John Doe the other day, and he mentioned he recently took up gardening. I never would have guessed he had a green thumb! Have you seen his backyard? Apparently, it’s blooming with flowers now. 

Also, I had a great conversation with Michael Snow last week. He shared some hilarious stories from his recent trip. It sounds like he had quite the adventure! 

And I can’t forget about Summer Winter—she’s been raving about a new café she discovered. I’m curious to check it out. Have you been there yet? 

Anyway, it’s always nice to touch base and hear how everyone is doing. Let me know what’s new in your world!

Take care,  
[Your Name]
