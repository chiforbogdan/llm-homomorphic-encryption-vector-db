Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d reach out to see how things are going on your end.

I recently bumped into John Doe at a coffee shop, and we had a great chat about some of his recent adventures. He always has such interesting stories to share! I also heard from Michael Snow the other day; he mentioned he’s been getting into hiking lately. I can’t wait to see some of the photos he’s been taking—he’s always had an eye for capturing beautiful landscapes.

And how could I forget about Summer Winter? I saw that she just got back from a trip to the beach. The weather here has been mild, but I bet she enjoyed some sunshine and relaxation by the ocean.

Anyway, I’d love to hear what you’ve been up to lately! Are there any fun plans on the horizon?

Take care and looking forward to your reply!

Best,  
[Your Name]
