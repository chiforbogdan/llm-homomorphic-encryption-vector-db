Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It feels like ages since we last caught up. How have you been? 

I heard from John Doe the other day, and he mentioned he recently picked up hiking as a new hobby. It made me think of our last team outing! Have you been able to get outdoors much lately? 

Also, I ran into Michael Snow at a local coffee shop last week. He looked great and was raving about a new book he’s been reading. He always has such interesting recommendations! Speaking of books, have you read anything good recently? 

And Summer Winter has been sharing some fun travel stories on social media. I love how adventurous she is! It’s inspiring to see her exploring new places. 

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Let’s catch up soon!

Best,
[Your Name]
