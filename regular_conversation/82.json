Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a quick note.

How have John, Michael, and Summer been doing? I remember you mentioned they were working on that side project together. Did they ever come up with any fun ideas? I bet there’s never a dull moment with that crew! 

I recently caught up with some friends over the weekend, and we ended up reminiscing about some of the funny moments from our last team outing. It got me thinking about how great it would be to have a casual get-together again soon. Maybe we could plan something?

Let me know how things are going on your end when you get a chance! Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,  
[Your Name]
