Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It feels like ages since we last caught up. How have you been?

I was just thinking about John Doe's recent fishing trip—did he ever manage to catch that elusive big one he was after? I remember him mentioning it with such enthusiasm! 

And how's Michael Snow doing? I heard he took up hiking recently. I can only imagine the stories he has from those trails. Maybe he’ll share some tips for my own attempt at getting outdoors more!

Also, have you talked to Summer Winter lately? I saw on social media that she’s been experimenting with some new recipes. I’d love to hear how that’s going; her culinary skills always amaze me!

Let’s catch up soon. It’s always nice to chat about life outside of work.

Take care!

Best,
