Subject: Catching Up

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It feels like ages since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to check in.

How have you been? I heard that John Doe recently took a trip to the mountains. I can only imagine the breathtaking views he must have enjoyed! Did he bring back any interesting stories?

Also, I bumped into Michael Snow the other day, and he mentioned he’s been getting into gardening lately. It’s always fun to hear about his latest projects. Have you had a chance to chat with him recently? 

And how's Summer Winter doing? I remember she was planning a big event for her charity work. I hope everything went smoothly for her!

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
