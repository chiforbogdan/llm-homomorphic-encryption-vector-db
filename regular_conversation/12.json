Subject: Just Catching Up!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a line to see how things are going on your end.

I recently bumped into John Doe at a coffee shop, and we had a great chat about our favorite travel destinations. It sounds like he has some exciting trips planned for the upcoming months! Have you had a chance to connect with him lately?

Also, I heard from Michael Snow that he’s taken up hiking again. It seems like he’s been exploring some beautiful trails lately. I remember you mentioned enjoying the outdoors too—maybe you could swap some trail recommendations!

And how's Summer Winter doing? I remember she was working on some personal projects. I hope she’s finding time to enjoy her hobbies outside of work. It’s always inspiring to see colleagues pursuing their passions!

Looking forward to hearing from you. Let’s catch up soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
