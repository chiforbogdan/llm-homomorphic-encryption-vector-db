Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a line.

How have things been on your end? I’ve been hearing some fun stories about John Doe’s latest hiking adventures. I can’t believe he climbed that mountain last weekend! Have you had a chance to join him on any of those trips?

Also, I ran into Michael Snow the other day. He’s been busy with some interesting projects but still manages to make time for his weekend basketball games. I’m sure he’s still the star player!

And Summer Winter mentioned she’s planning a little getaway soon. I’m curious where she’s headed this time—she always finds the coolest places to visit!

Anyway, I’d love to hear what you’ve been up to. Let’s catch up soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
