Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a note to see how things are going on your end.

How has John Doe been? I remember he was working on that passion project of his. Did he finally get it off the ground? I always admired his determination!

And what about Michael Snow? I heard he took a trip recently. I’d love to hear about his adventures. It’s always fun to hear about the places he visits and the stories he brings back.

As for Summer Winter, I hope she’s enjoying the beautiful autumn weather. This time of year always reminds me of cozy evenings and warm drinks. I can’t believe the holidays are just around the corner!

Anyway, I just wanted to reach out and say hi. Let’s make a plan to catch up soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
