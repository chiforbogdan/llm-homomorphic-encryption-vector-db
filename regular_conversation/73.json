Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a line to see how things are going on your end.

I heard from John Doe that he recently tried his hand at cooking a new recipe over the weekend. He mentioned it was a bit of a disaster but entertaining nonetheless! Have you had any culinary adventures lately? 

Also, I ran into Michael Snow at the coffee shop last week. He was telling me about his recent hiking trip. It sounds like he had a fantastic time exploring some new trails—definitely made me want to get outdoors more! 

And Summer Winter shared some exciting news about her recent travels. She visited a few places that she absolutely loved and came back with some amazing stories. Do you have any trips planned soon? 

Anyway, just wanted to say hi and see how things are with you. Looking forward to hearing back!

Best,  
[Your Name]
