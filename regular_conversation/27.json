Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we caught up. How have you been?

I heard that John Doe recently took a trip to the mountains. I’m sure he had a great time hiking and enjoying the fresh air! Did he share any stories with you? 

Also, I ran into Michael Snow the other day. He was raving about a new coffee shop that just opened downtown. Have you had a chance to try it out yet? I’m always on the lookout for a good cup of coffee!

And how’s Summer Winter doing? I remember she mentioned she was getting into gardening. I’d love to hear how that’s going for her. Maybe she’s growing some amazing vegetables by now!

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
