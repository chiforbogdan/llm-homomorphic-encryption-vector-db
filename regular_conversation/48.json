Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up. How have you been?

I recently ran into John Doe at a coffee shop, and we had a great chat about his recent hiking trip. He always has the best stories! Have you had a chance to catch up with him lately? 

Also, I heard Michael Snow has taken up gardening. I can't imagine him with a green thumb, but I guess we all have our hidden talents! Have you seen any of his new plants? 

And how is Summer Winter doing? I remember her mentioning a new fitness routine she was excited about last time we spoke. I’d love to hear how that’s going for her!

Anyway, just wanted to touch base and see how things are going on your end. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
