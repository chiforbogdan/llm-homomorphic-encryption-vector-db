Subject: Catching Up!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It feels like ages since we last caught up. How have you been?

I was just thinking about our last team outing and how much fun it was to see everyone together. John Doe really knows how to keep the energy up, doesn’t he? I still chuckle when I remember his dance moves! And Michael Snow’s jokes always seem to lighten the mood—he’s such a great storyteller. 

I also wanted to ask how Summer Winter has been doing lately. I remember she mentioned some exciting plans for the upcoming holidays. Have you heard anything from her? 

It would be great to hear about what you’ve been up to as well! Let’s catch up soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
