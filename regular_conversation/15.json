Subject: Catching Up!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It's been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to check in.

How have you been? I recently heard that John Doe has taken up gardening as a new hobby. I can only imagine the kind of green thumb he's developing! Do you think he'll have a mini jungle in his backyard soon?

Also, I ran into Michael Snow the other day. He was telling me about his recent hiking trip. It sounds like he had quite the adventure! Have you had any fun outings lately?

And I can't forget to ask about Summer Winterâ€”she mentioned something about trying out a new recipe. I wonder if it turned out as delicious as she hoped! 

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
