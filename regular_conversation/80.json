Subject: Just Checking In

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d reach out for a little chat.

How have you been? I was just thinking about our last team outing and how much fun everyone had. I still can’t get over John Doe’s impressive karaoke skills! He really stole the show that night. And Michael Snow—his dance moves were something else, right? It’s always great to see everyone let loose and just enjoy the moment.

Also, I’ve been meaning to ask how Summer Winter is doing. I remember she had some exciting travel plans recently. Did she end up going on that trip she was talking about? I’d love to hear all about it!

Anyway, I hope you’re having a lovely week. Let’s catch up soon, maybe over coffee or a virtual chat!

Best,  
[Your Name]
