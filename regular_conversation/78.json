Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It feels like ages since we last caught up. How have you been? 

I’ve been thinking about our last conversation, and I hope John Doe is doing well with his new project. His enthusiasm is always contagious! Also, I heard that Michael Snow recently took up hiking—have you heard any interesting stories from his adventures? I can only imagine what kind of tales he has to tell!

And Summer Winter—what a fitting name for someone who seems to radiate warmth no matter the season! I can’t believe how quickly the year is flying by; it feels like summer was just yesterday. 

Looking forward to hearing back from you! Let’s catch up soon.

Best,  
[Your Name]
