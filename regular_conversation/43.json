Subject: Catching Up!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to touch base.

How have things been with you? I was chatting with John Doe the other day, and he mentioned he’s been trying out that new coffee shop downtown. Have you been there yet? I’ve heard they have an amazing selection of pastries too!

Also, I ran into Michael Snow last weekend at a local event. He was telling me about his recent hiking trip—sounds like quite the adventure! I’m hoping to get some hiking in myself before the weather turns too chilly.

And of course, I can't forget about Summer Winter! I saw her post some fantastic photos from her recent travels on social media. It really makes me want to plan a getaway soon.

Let’s find some time to chat soon. I’d love to hear what you’ve been up to!

Best,  
[Your Name]
