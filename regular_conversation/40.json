Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It's been a while since we caught up, and I thought I'd drop you a quick note.

How are things going on your end? I was just chatting with John Doe the other day, and he mentioned he took a little weekend trip recently. I’m curious to hear about the places he visited—he always has the best travel stories!

Also, I ran into Michael Snow last week. He was raving about a new restaurant that opened up downtown. Have you had a chance to check it out yet? I think it’s right up our alley for some great food and atmosphere.

And how’s Summer Winter doing? I remember she was planning a big family gathering. I hope it went well! It’s always nice to hear about her adventures with the family.

Anyway, just wanted to say hi and see how you’re doing. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
