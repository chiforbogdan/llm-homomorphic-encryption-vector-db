Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a note to see how things are going on your end.

I was chatting with John Doe the other day, and he mentioned he recently picked up gardening as a hobby. I can’t believe how green his thumb has become! Have you had a chance to catch up with him lately? 

Also, I ran into Michael Snow last week, and he was raving about his latest hiking trip. He always finds the best trails! I need to get some recommendations from him for my upcoming weekend getaway. 

And how is Summer Winter doing? I remember she was planning a big trip this year. I hope she had a fantastic time and has some great stories to share!

Let’s catch up soon—maybe over coffee or a video call? It would be great to hear what everyone’s been up to lately.

Take care and talk soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
