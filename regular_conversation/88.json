Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we caught up, and I thought I’d reach out to see how things are going on your end.

I heard that John Doe recently took a trip to the mountains. I can only imagine how beautiful the scenery must have been this time of year! Did he bring back any fun stories?

Also, I ran into Michael Snow the other day. He was raving about that new café that just opened downtown. It sounds like a great spot for a coffee break. Have you had a chance to check it out yet?

And of course, I can’t forget about Summer Winter! I saw her post some amazing photos from a recent event. She really has a knack for capturing the moment, doesn’t she? 

Anyway, I just wanted to say hi and catch up a little. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
