Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a note to see how things are going on your side.

I heard that John Doe has been getting into photography lately. Have you seen any of his recent shots? I bet they’re stunning! I remember he always had an eye for capturing the perfect moment.

Also, how’s Michael Snow? I’ve been meaning to ask if he’s still working on his cooking skills. I remember he was experimenting with some new recipes the last time we spoke. I’d love to hear if he’s managed to whip up anything delicious!

And what about Summer Winter? I hope she’s doing well! I remember she mentioned something about hiking over the summer. Did she end up going on any great adventures? 

Looking forward to hearing from you! Let’s catch up soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
