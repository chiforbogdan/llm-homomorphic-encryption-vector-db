Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up. How have you been? I was just reminiscing about our last chat and thought I’d reach out.

I heard John Doe recently took up hiking. He’s been sharing some stunning photos from his weekend adventures. It’s awesome to see him exploring the great outdoors! I bet he’s going to have some amazing stories to tell.

Also, how’s Michael Snow doing? I remember he mentioned he was getting into cooking. I’m curious if he’s been experimenting with any new recipes lately. Maybe he can share his culinary secrets next time we all get together!

And Summer Winter – what a name, right? I hope she’s still enjoying her painting classes. I’ve seen some of her artwork on social media, and it’s incredible! Such talent!

Anyway, I just wanted to say hi and see how things are going on your end. Let’s catch up soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
