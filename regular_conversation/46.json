Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up. How have you been? 

I recently ran into John Doe at a local coffee shop. He was raving about a new café he discovered that serves amazing pastries. I think he might have convinced me to check it out this weekend! Have you had a chance to try any new spots lately?

Also, I saw Michael Snow the other day at the park. He was out jogging and looked like he was in great shape! It made me think that I really need to get back into a regular exercise routine. Do you have any favorite workouts or activities you like to do?

And how’s Summer Winter doing? I remember she mentioned her plans for a mini-vacation. I hope she had a great time! It’s always nice to take a break and recharge.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
