Subject: Catching Up!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to check in.

How have you been? I’ve heard that John Doe recently took a weekend trip to the mountains. It must have been a refreshing break for him! Did you happen to catch any of the photos he shared? The views looked stunning.

Also, I ran into Michael Snow the other day. He was telling me about his new hobby of gardening. It’s great to see him so passionate about it! I could never keep a plant alive for more than a week, so I admire anyone who can.

And I can’t forget about Summer Winter! I saw she’s been posting about her recent cooking adventures online. Her recipes always seem delicious, and I’m tempted to try making one of them myself—though I might need a lot of practice!

Looking forward to hearing how things are going on your end. Let’s catch up soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
