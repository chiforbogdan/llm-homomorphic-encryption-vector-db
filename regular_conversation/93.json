Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It feels like ages since we last caught up. How have you been?

I recently bumped into John Doe at a local café, and he mentioned how he’s been getting into gardening lately. It’s interesting to hear about his new hobby! I remember him saying he had a knack for keeping plants alive, which is something I definitely struggle with!

Also, I saw Michael Snow at a community event last weekend. He was his usual charming self, sharing stories and making everyone laugh. It’s always a pleasure to see him—his energy is infectious! 

And how’s Summer Winter doing? I hope she’s managing to find some time for herself amidst everything. I remember her mentioning she was planning a little getaway; I hope she got to relax and recharge.

Let’s catch up soon! I’d love to hear all about what you’ve been up to lately.

Take care,
