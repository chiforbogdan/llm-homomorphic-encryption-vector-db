Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a line to see how everything is going on your end.

I heard that John Doe recently took a trip to the mountains. I can only imagine how beautiful it must have been this time of year! Did he share any fun stories from his adventure? 

Also, I was chatting with Michael Snow the other day, and he mentioned he’s been exploring some new hobbies. I’m curious to know what he’s gotten into lately. I always enjoy hearing about what new interests people are picking up!

And how’s Summer Winter doing? I can’t believe the holiday season is just around the corner. I hope she’s been able to enjoy some downtime amidst all the busyness. 

Anyway, I’d love to hear what you’ve been up to as well! Let’s catch up soon.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
