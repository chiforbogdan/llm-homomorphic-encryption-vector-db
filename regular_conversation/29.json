Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a note to see how things are going on your end.

I heard from John Doe the other day, and he mentioned he’s been keeping busy with some exciting projects. It’s always great to hear about the innovative things he’s up to! Also, I bumped into Michael Snow last weekend at a local café. We ended up chatting for hours about everything from travel to the latest movies. Have you seen any good films lately? 

And how’s Summer Winter handling everything? I remember she was planning a trip soon. I hope she gets some well-deserved relaxation time!

Anyway, I’d love to hear what you’ve been up to lately. Let’s catch up soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
