Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! I was just thinking about our last chat and wanted to catch up a bit. How have you been lately?

I heard that John Doe had quite the adventure over the weekend. He mentioned something about hiking, and knowing him, I bet he’s got some great stories to share! Have you had a chance to catch up with him recently?

Also, I saw that Michael Snow finally went on that trip he’d been planning for ages. I can only imagine the amazing photos he must have taken. Did he show you any yet? 

And what about Summer Winter? I know she was gearing up for a big family gathering—did she end up hosting it? I’m sure it was a blast!

Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Let’s catch up properly sometime!

Best,  
[Your Name]
