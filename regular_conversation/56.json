Subject: Catching Up!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a quick message to see how things are going on your end.

How’s everything with John Doe? I remember you mentioned he was working on some interesting projects lately. It’d be great to hear what he’s been up to! 

And what about Michael Snow? I heard he recently took a trip somewhere exciting. Did he end up going to that place he was dreaming about? 

Also, how’s Summer Winter doing? I hope she’s managing to find some time to relax amidst her busy schedule. I can only imagine how hectic things must be!

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
