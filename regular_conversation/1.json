Subject: Hope You're Doing Well!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! I was just thinking about our last chat and how much I enjoyed hearing your thoughts on everything. It seems like there's always so much to catch up on!

How have John Doe and Michael Snow been? I remember you mentioning they were working on some interesting side projects. I hope they're finding some time to enjoy the weather tooâ€”it's been beautiful lately!

And speaking of the weather, Summer Winter must be loving this time of year! I can't believe how quickly the seasons are changing. Do you have any fun plans for the upcoming months? 

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
