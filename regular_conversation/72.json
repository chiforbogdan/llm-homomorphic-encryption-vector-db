Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d take a moment to say hello.

How have you been? I was just reminiscing about our last team outing and how much fun we had. I still can’t believe John Doe managed to convince us to try that bizarre food truck. I wonder if he’s still raving about it! 

And how’s Michael Snow doing? I heard he’s taken up hiking lately. I can only imagine the stories he must have from his adventures. Maybe he can give us some tips for our next outing!

Oh, and what about Summer Winter? I saw her posting some amazing travel photos on social media. It looks like she’s been having a blast exploring new places. I’d love to hear about her latest escapades when you get a chance.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
