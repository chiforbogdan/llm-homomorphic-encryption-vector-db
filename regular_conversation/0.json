Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we caught up, and I thought I’d reach out to see how things are going on your side.

How’s John Doe doing? I remember he was working on that project that had everyone buzzing. Has he come up with any new ideas? 

I also wanted to ask about Michael Snow. I heard he recently took a trip somewhere exciting. I’d love to hear all about it if he’s back and has time to share some stories!

And Summer Winter—how is she enjoying the season? I imagine she’s out and about, making the most of it. Any fun plans coming up?

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
