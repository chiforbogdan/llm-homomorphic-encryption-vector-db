Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It's been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to touch base.

How have you been? I heard that John Doe recently took a trip to the mountains. I can only imagine how refreshing that must have been! Did he share any fun stories about his adventure? 

Also, I saw that Michael Snow has been getting into photography lately. I’d love to hear about what inspired him to pick up the camera! It's always fascinating to see how our interests evolve over time.

And what about Summer Winter? I hope she's doing well. I remember she mentioned wanting to try out a new hobby. Any updates on that front? 

It's always great to hear what everyone is up to outside of work. Let’s catch up soon – maybe over a virtual coffee?

Take care!

Best,  
[Your Name]
