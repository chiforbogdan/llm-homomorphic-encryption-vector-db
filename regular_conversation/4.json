Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to just chat a bit.

How has everything been on your end? I was just thinking about our last conversation and how John Doe mentioned he was trying out that new coffee shop downtown. Did he end up liking it? I’ve heard it has a great atmosphere!

Also, I saw that Michael Snow had a fantastic time at that concert last weekend. I remember he was really excited about it. Did you end up going too? I’d love to hear about it if you did!

And Summer Winter must be busy with her gardening hobby. I remember she mentioned trying to grow some vegetables. I hope her plants are thriving!

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
