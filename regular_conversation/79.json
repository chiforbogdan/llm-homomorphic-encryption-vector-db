Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It's been a while since we caught up, and I thought it would be nice to touch base.

How have you been? I heard that John Doe recently went on a hiking trip—he must have some great stories to share! It seems like Michael Snow has been keeping busy with his photography; I’d love to see some of his latest shots. And Summer Winter has been raving about her new garden project; she mentioned a few unique plants she’s trying out this season.

It's always refreshing to hear about what everyone’s up to outside of work. Have you had a chance to do anything fun lately? 

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
