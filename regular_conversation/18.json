Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! I was just thinking about how fast the year is flying by. Can you believe it’s almost November? It feels like just yesterday we were enjoying the summer sunshine.

Speaking of summer, I hope Summer Winter is doing great! I remember you mentioning her recent trip—did she have a great time? And how’s John Doe holding up with his new project? I’m sure he’s making waves as usual! As for Michael Snow, I heard he’s taken up cooking again. I can’t wait to hear about his latest culinary adventures.

Let me know how things are going on your end when you get a chance. It’s always nice to catch up!

Best,  
[Your Name]
