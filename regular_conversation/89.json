Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a note to see how things are going on your end.

I heard from John Doe the other day, and he mentioned he’s been getting into hiking lately. It sounds like he’s really enjoying the great outdoors! Have you had a chance to join him on any of those adventures? 

Also, I ran into Michael Snow at a coffee shop last week. He was joking about how he’s trying to perfect his latte art skills—he showed me a picture of his latest creation, and let’s just say, it looked like a work in progress! I’m sure he’ll get the hang of it soon.

And how’s Summer Winter doing? I remember she was planning a little getaway. Did she end up going? I’d love to hear about her travels if you’ve spoken with her recently.

Looking forward to hearing from you! 

Best,  
[Your Name]
