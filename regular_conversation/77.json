Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It feels like ages since we last caught up. How have you been? 

I was just reminiscing about that fun outing we had last summer. Speaking of summer, I heard Summer Winter had an amazing vacation recently—she mentioned she got to explore some beautiful beaches. I can only imagine how relaxing that must have been!

Also, I ran into John Doe the other day, and he was sharing some hilarious stories from his recent camping trip. It sounds like he really embraced the great outdoors! Have you talked to Michael Snow lately? I remember he had some interesting travel plans lined up. I’d love to hear how that went!

Anyway, I just wanted to touch base and see how you’re doing. Let’s catch up soon!

Best,
