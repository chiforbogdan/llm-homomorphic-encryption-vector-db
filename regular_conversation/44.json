Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to touch base and chat a bit.

How have you been? I recently had a chance to catch up with John Doe, and he mentioned he’s been diving into some new hobbies. Have you had a chance to see what he’s up to? I can’t help but wonder if he’s finally taken that pottery class he was always talking about!

I also bumped into Michael Snow the other day. He seemed really excited about his latest travel plans. I think he mentioned something about visiting a national park soon. I hope he gets some great photos to share!

And Summer Winter? I saw her post some amazing hiking pictures on social media recently. It looks like she’s been exploring some beautiful trails. Do you get a chance to hike much these days?

Anyway, I just wanted to reach out and see how everything is going on your end. Let’s catch up soon!

Best,  
[Your Name]
