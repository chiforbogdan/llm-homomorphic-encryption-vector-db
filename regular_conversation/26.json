Subject: Catching Up!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up. How have you been? 

I was just reminiscing about the last team outing and couldn’t help but laugh at John Doe’s hilarious dance moves! I swear, he could give any professional dancer a run for their money! Speaking of fun, I heard that Michael Snow recently took up hiking. Have you heard about his adventures? I can only imagine the incredible views he’s been sharing.

And what about Summer Winter? I bumped into her last weekend, and she mentioned that she’s been experimenting with new recipes. I’d love to hear more about what she’s been cooking up!

I guess we all have our little hobbies keeping us busy. Let’s make sure to find some time to catch up soon—maybe over coffee? 

Take care and looking forward to your reply!

Best,  
[Your Name]
