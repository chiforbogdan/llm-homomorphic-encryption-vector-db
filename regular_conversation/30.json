Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to take a break from the usual work chat.

How have you been? I heard that John Doe recently picked up hiking! I can only imagine the stories he has from his adventures. Maybe he’ll convince us to join him one of these weekends!

And what about Michael Snow? I saw a picture of him at that new café downtown. I’ve been meaning to check it out! I heard they have the best pastries. 

Oh, and Summer Winter mentioned she’s planning a little getaway soon. I’m so curious to hear where she’s headed! It’s always interesting to see her travel stories. 

Anyway, I hope you’re having a great week! Let’s catch up soon – it would be nice to chat about life outside of work!

Take care,
