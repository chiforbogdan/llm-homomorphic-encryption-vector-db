Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a line to see how things have been going on your end.

How’s John Doe doing? I remember he was really excited about his latest project. Has he managed to wrap it up yet? 

And what about Michael Snow? I’ve been hearing some great things about his new hobbies. I’m curious to know if he’s still into photography or if he’s picked up something new. 

Also, how’s Summer Winter? I hope she’s enjoying the change of seasons! It’s always nice to hear about her outdoor adventures. 

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
