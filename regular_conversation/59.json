Subject: Catching Up!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It's been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be great to check in and see how things are going on your end.

I heard that John Doe recently took up hiking—how's that going for him? I can only imagine the beautiful trails he must be exploring. Michael Snow mentioned he’s been experimenting with some new recipes in the kitchen. I’d love to know what culinary delights he’s come up with! And Summer Winter has been quite the busy bee, I believe she’s diving into some gardening projects. I can’t wait to hear about the flowers and veggies she’s growing.

It’s always nice to hear what everyone is up to outside of work. Let’s plan to catch up soon!

Take care,

[Your Name]
