Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It feels like ages since we last caught up. How have things been on your end? 

I was thinking about our recent conversations and how John Doe always brings such a unique perspective to our discussions. His insights really add a fun twist to our brainstorming sessions! Also, I heard that Michael Snow recently picked up hiking. Have you had a chance to join him on any of those adventures? I can only imagine the beautiful views he must be enjoying out there!

And of course, Summer Winter has been a breath of fresh air with her positive energy. It’s hard not to smile when she’s around! I can’t wait for the next team gathering to see everyone again. 

Let me know how things are going with you, and if you have any fun plans for the upcoming weekend!

Best,  
[Your Name]
