Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a line to see how things are going on your end.

How’s John Doe doing? I remember he mentioned he was working on some new hobbies recently. Did he end up taking that cooking class he was talking about? I’d love to hear about his culinary adventures!

Also, I was chatting with Michael Snow the other day. He mentioned he’s been getting into hiking lately. Have you had the chance to explore any new trails? I’m always on the lookout for good recommendations!

And of course, how’s Summer Winter? I heard she recently took a trip somewhere exciting. I can’t wait to hear all about it—she always has the best travel stories.

Let’s catch up soon! It would be great to hear all the updates and share some laughs.

Take care!

Best,  
[Your Name]
