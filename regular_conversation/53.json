Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be nice to reach out and see how things are going on your end.

How’s everything with John Doe? I remember he was working on that exciting project last we spoke. I hope it’s all coming together nicely for him. Also, have you had a chance to catch up with Michael Snow lately? I heard he recently took a trip to the mountains – I bet he has some great stories to share!

And what about Summer Winter? I can’t believe how fast the year is flying by! I hope she’s enjoying her time and maybe even planning some fun activities for the upcoming holidays.

As for me, I’ve been trying to find some time to relax and unwind in between everything. It’s always nice to take a breather and enjoy the little things, don’t you think?

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
[Your Name]
