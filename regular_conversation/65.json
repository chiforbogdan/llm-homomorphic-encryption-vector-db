Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we last caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a line to see how things are going on your end.

I was chatting with John Doe the other day, and he mentioned that he recently picked up hiking as a new hobby. I remember he used to love spending time outdoors — it sounds like a great way to enjoy the fall colors! Have you had a chance to get outside and enjoy the changing seasons? 

Also, I ran into Michael Snow at a local café last week. He was raving about a new book he’s reading. I’m always on the lookout for something good to dive into, so I’ll have to ask him for the title. Do you have any recommendations? 

And how’s Summer Winter doing? I hope she’s been well! I remember her mentioning she was planning a little getaway soon. I can only imagine how refreshing that must be!

Anyway, just wanted to catch up and see how you all are doing. Let me know if you’d like to grab coffee sometime soon!

Take care,
