Subject: Just Checking In!

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been a while since we caught up, and I thought I’d drop you a line.

How’s everything going on your end? I was just thinking about our last conversation and how much fun it was to hear about your recent hiking trip. I’ve been meaning to ask if you’ve had any more outdoor adventures since then!

I saw that John Doe recently shared some photos from his vacation. It looked like he had a fantastic time! Have you spoken to him lately? I wonder if he’s planning any more trips soon.

Also, I bumped into Michael Snow the other day. We had a great chat about the new coffee shop that opened up downtown. Have you had a chance to check it out? I hear their pastries are to die for!

And what about Summer Winter? I can’t believe the holiday season is just around the corner. I remember she mentioned she was planning a big gathering this year. I’d love to hear how her preparations are going!

Looking forward to hearing from you! Let’s catch up soon.

Best,  
[Your Name]
