FIG. 1 provides a front, perspective view of a range appliance 100 as may be employed with the present subject mailer. FIG. 2 provides a top, plan view of range appliance 100. Range appliance 100 includes an insulated cabinet 110. Cabinet 110 defines an upper cooking chamber 120 and a lower cooking chamber 122. Thus, range appliance 100 is generally referred to as a double oven range appliance. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, range appliance 100 is provided by way of example only, and the present subject matter may be used in any suitable cooktop appliance, e.g., a single oven range appliance or a standalone cooktop appliance. Thus, the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 1 is not intended to limit the present subject matter to any particular cooking chamber configuration or arrangement. Upper and lower cooking chambers 120 and 122 are configured for the receipt of one or more food items to be cooked. Range appliance 100 includes an upper door 124 and a lower door 126 rotatably attached to cabinet 110 in order to permit selective access to upper cooking chamber 120 and lower cooking chamber 122, respectively. Handles 128 are mounted to upper and lower doors 124 and 126 to assist a user with opening and closing doors 124 and 126 in order to access cooking chambers 120 and 122. As an example, a user can pull on handle 128 mounted to upper door 124 to open or close upper door 124 and access upper cooking chamber 120. Glass window panes 130 provide for viewing the contents of upper and lower cooking chambers 120 and 122 when doors 124 and 126 are closed and also assist with insulating upper and lower cooking chambers 120 and 122. Heating elements (not shown), such as electric resistance heating elements, gas burners, microwave heating elements, halogen heating elements, or suitable combinations thereof, are positioned within upper cooking chamber 120 and lower cooking chamber 122 for heating upper cooking chamber 120 and lower cooking chamber 122. Range appliance 100 also includes a cooktop 140. Cooktop 140 is positioned at or adjacent a top portion of cabinet 110. Thus, cooktop 140 is positioned above upper and lower cooking chambers 120 and 122. Cooktop 140 includes a top panel 142. By way of example, top panel 142 may be constructed of glass, ceramics, enameled steel, and combinations thereof. For range appliance 100, a utensil holding food and/or cooking liquids (e.g., oil, water, etc.) may be placed onto grates 152 at a location of any of burner assemblies 144, 146, 148, 150. Burner assemblies 144, 146, 148, 150 provide therrnal energy to cooking utensils on grates 152. As shown in FIG. 1, burners assemblies 144, 146, 148, 150 can be configured in various sizes so as to provide e.g., for the receipt of cooking utensils (i.e., pots, pans, etc.) of various sizes and configurations and to provide different heat inputs for such cooking utensils. Grates 152 are supported on a top surface 158 of top panel 142. Range appliance 100 also includes a griddle burner 160 positioned at a middle portion of top panel 142, as may be seen in FIG. 2. A griddle may be positioned on grates 152 and heated with griddle burner 160. A user interface panel 154 is located within convenient reach of a user of the range appliance 100. For this exemplary embodiment, user interface panel 154 includes knobs 156 that are each associated with one of burner assemblies 144, 146, 148, 150 and griddle burner 160. Knobs 156 allow the user to activate each burner assembly and determine the amount of heat input provided by each burner assembly 144, 146, 148, 150 and griddle burner 160 to a cooking utensil located thereon. User interface panel 154 may also be provided with one or more graphical display devices that deliver certain information to the user such as e.g., whether a particular burner assembly is activated and/or the rate at which the burner assembly is set. Although shown with knobs 156, it should be understood that knobs 156 and the configuration of range appliance 100 shown in FIG. 1 is provided by way of example only. More specifically, user interface panel 154 may include various input components, such as one or more of a variety of touch-type controls, electrical, mechanical or electro-mechanical input devices including rotary dials, push buttons, and touch pads, e.g., in addition to knobs 156. The user interface panel 154 may include other display components, such as a digital or analog display device designed to provide operational feedback to a user. FIG. 3 provides a side, elevation view of a control panel assembly 200 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present subject matter. FIG. 4 provides a side, section view of control panel assembly 200. FIG. 5 provides an exploded, section view of control panel assembly 200. Control panel assembly 200 may be used in or within any suitable cooktop appliance. For example, control panel assembly 200 may be used in or within range appliance 100. Thus, control panel assembly 200 is discussed in greater detail below in the context of range appliance 100. As may be seen in FIGS. 3-5, control panel assembly 200 includes a panel 210, a knob 220 (e.g., one of knobs 156) and a control valve 230. Panel 210 may be part of top panel 142 of range appliance 100 (FIG. 1) or may be separate from top panel 142. Panel 210 defines an outer surface 212 and an inner surface 214. Outer and inner surfaces 212, 214 of panel 210 are positioned opposite each other on panel 210. For example, inner surface 214 of panel 210 may face an interior of range appliance 100, and outer surface 212 of panel 210 may face away from the interior of range appliance 100. Panel 210 also defines an opening 216. Opening 216 of panel 210 extends through panel 210, e.g., between outer and inner surfaces 212, 214 of panel 210. Knob 220 and control valve 230 are positioned at or adjacent opening 216 of panel 210. As an example, knob 220 and control valve 230 may be positioned opposite each other about panel 210. In particular, knob 220 may be positioned at or adjacent outer surface 214 of panel 210 proximate opening 216 of panel 210, and control valve 230 may be positioned at or adjacent inner surface 214 of panel 210 proximate opening 216 of panel 210. Control valve 230 includes a valve body 232, a stem 234, manifold 236 and manifold bracket 238. Valve body 232 is configured for housing various components of control valve 230 that regulate a flow of gaseous fuel, such as propane or natural gas, from a fuel line to manifold 236. In particular, control valve 230 is selectively adjustable between an open configuration and a closed configuration. In the closed configuration, control valve 230 blocks gaseous fuel flow to manifold 236. Conversely, control valve 230 permits gaseous fuel flow to manifold 236 in the open configuration. Stem 234 extends from valve body 232 through panel 210 at opening 216 of panel 210. Knob 220 is coupled (e.g., mounted to) stem 234. A user may rotate knob 220 in order to adjust control valve 230 between the open and closed configurations. Manifold 236 extends from valve body 232 to one of burner assemblies 144, 146, 148, 150 in order to supply fuel from valve body 232 thereto. Control valve 230 may be mounted to panel 210. For example, manifold 236 may be connected to valve body 232 at an outlet of the valve body 232, and manifold bracket 238 may be mounted (e.g., fastened) to panel 210. Manifold 236 may be mounted to (e.g., fastened) to manifold bracket 238. In such a manner, control valve 230 may be connected and mounted to panel 210. Control panel assembly 200 also includes a spark switch 260. Spark switch 260 is configured for electrically connecting a power supply to an igniter at one of burner assemblies 144, 146, 148, 150. In particular, spark switch 260 may be configured for closing an electrical circuit to the igniter when a user rotates knob 220 such that control valve 230 is in the open configuration, and spark switch 260 may be configured for opening the electrical circuit to the igniter when the user rotates knob 220 such that control valve 230 is in the closed configuration. In such a manner, spark switch 260 may assist with igniting gaseous fuel at burners of range appliance 100, as will be understood by those skilled in the art. Spark switch 260 may be mounted to control valve 230. For example, an outer housing 264 of spark switch 260 may be mounted to valve body 232 such that outer housing 264 of spark switch 260 is fixed relative to valve body 232. Conversely, a rotor 266 of spark switch 260 may be mounted to stem 234 such that rotor 266 of spark switch 260 is fixed relative to stem 234. Knob 220 may be positioned opposite spark switch 260 about panel 210. By coupling rotor 266 of spark switch 260 to stem 234, rotor 266 of spark switch 260 may rotate within outer housing 264 when a user rotates knob 220. Spark switch 260, e.g., outer housing 264 of spark switch 260, may also include an outer wall 262. As may be seen in FIG. 4, control valve 230 defines an axial direction A along a length of stem 234. Outer wall 262 of spark switch 260 may be circular in a plane that is perpendicular to the axial direction A. Thus, outer wall 262 of spark switch 260 may be cylindrical or round in certain exemplary embodiments. Control panel assembly 200 also includes a bezel 240. Bezel 240 is disposed between knob 220 and panel 210 and is positioned on panel 210. Bezel 240 may cover or hide a gap between knob 220 and panel 210 in order to improve a cosmetic appearance of range appliance 100. As discussed in greater detail below, bezel 240 includes features for positioning bezel 240 such that opening 216 of panel 210, stem 234, bezel 240 and/or spark switch 260 are positioned concentrically with one another. FIG. 6 provides a perspective view of bezel 240. FIG. 7 provides a side, section view of bezel 240. As may be seen in FIGS. 6 and 7, bezel 240 includes a mounting plate 242, an outer sidewall 246 and an inner sidewall 250. Mounting plate 242 may be positioned on or at panel 210 such that mounting plate 242 is disposed between knob 220 and panel 210 at opening 216 of panel 210. Mounting plate 242 may define a plurality of holes 244. Fasteners (not shown), such as screws, may extend through mounting plate 242 and panel 210 at holes 244 in order to assist with mounting bezel 240 to panel 210. Mounting plate 242 may be circular, e.g., in a plane that is perpendicular to the axial direction A. Thus, an outer edge 248 of mounting plate 242 may be circular in the plane that is perpendicular to the axial direction A. Outer sidewall 246 is attached to mounting plate 242. In addition, outer sidewall 246 may extend about mounting plate 242 at outer edge 248 of mounting plate 242. Outer sidewall 246 may further extend from mounting plate 242 towards knob 220. Outer sidewall 246 may be circular in a plane that is perpendicular to the axial direction A. Thus, outer sidewall 246 may be cylindrical or round in certain exemplary embodiments. A diameter of outer sidewall 246 may be larger than a diameter of knob 220. Thus, a base 222 of knob 220 may be disposed within outer sidewall 246 adjacent mounting plate 242. In such a manner, outer sidewall 246 may assist with covering or hiding a gap between knob 220 and panel 210. Inner sidewall 250 is attached to mounting plate 242. Inner side-wall 250 may also be positioned at or adjacent an inner portion 252 of mounting plate 242, e.g., radially spaced apart from outer edge 248 of mounting plate 242. Inner sidewall 250 may further extend from mounting plate 242 through panel 210 at opening 216 of panel 210. Inner sidewall 250 may be circular in a plane that is perpendicular to the axial direction A. Thus, inner sidewall 250 may be cylindrical or round in certain exemplary embodiments. A shape of opening 216 of panel 210 in a plane that is perpendicular to the axial direction A may be complementary to a shape of inner sidewall 250 of bezel 240 in the plane that is perpendicular to the axial direction. Thus, opening 216 of panel 210 may be sized and shaped to receive inner sidewall 250 of bezel 240. Similarly, a shape of outer wall 262 of spark switch 260 may be complementary to the shape of the inner sidewall 250 in the plane that is perpendicular to the axial direction. Thus, inner sidewall 250 of bezel 240 may be sized and shaped to receive outer wall 262 of spark switch 260. With inner sidewall 250 of bezel 240 received within opening 216 of panel 210 and/or with outer wall 262 of spark switch 260 received within inner sidewall 250 of bezel 240, opening 216 of panel 210, stem 234, bezel 240 and/or spark switch 260 may be positioned concentrically with one another. As a particular example, an outer diameter DSO of inner sidewall 250 may be about equal to a diameter DO of opening 216 of panel 210 when inner sidewall 250 is round. Thus, inner sidewall 250 may be received within opening 216 of panel 210 such that inner sidewall 250 contacts panel 210 at opening 216 of panel 210. In such a manner, inner sidewall 250 may engage panel 210 in order to assist with positioning bezel 240 concentrically with knob 220. Similarly, an inner diameter DSI of inner sidewall 250 may be about equal to a diameter DW of outer wall 262 of spark switch 260 when inner sidewall 250 is round. Thus, inner side wall 250 may receive outer wall 262 of spark switch 260 such that inner sidewall 250 contacts outer wall 262 of spark switch 260. In such a manner, inner sidewall 250 may engage outer wall 262 of spark switch 260 in order to assist with positioning bezel 240 concentrically with knob 220 and/or outer wall 262 of spark switch 260 at opening 216 of panel 210. As used herein the term \u201cabout\u201d means within five millimeters of a stated diameter when used in the context of diameters. Bezel 240 may also include a lip 254. Lip 254 is attached or connected to mounting plate 242. In particular, outer sidewall 246 may extend between and connect mounting plate 242 and lip 254. Lip 254 may also extend about outer edge 248 of mounting plate 242. Lip 254 may extend from outer sidewall 246 (e.g., a distal end of outer sidewall 246) to panel 210. As shown in FIG. 7, lip 254 may also be spaced apart from outer sidewall 246 except where lip 254 is connected to outer sidewall 246 at the distal end of outer sidewall 246. Lip 254 may extend from outer sidewall 246 past mounting plate 242 such that a distal end of lip 254 stands proud of mounting plate 242. Thus, lip 254 may support mounting plate 242 on panel 210 such that mounting plate 242 is spaced apart from or suspended over panel 210 by lip 254, as shown in FIG. 4. Lip 254 may also be compressed against panel 210 in order to reduce or eliminate a visible gap between bezel 240 and panel 210. Bezel 240 may be constructed of or with any suitable material. For example, bezel 240 may be constructed of or with injection molded plastic or cast metal. Thus, mounting plate 242, outer sidewall 246 and inner sidewall 250 of bezel 240 may be integrally formed of a single, continuous piece of plastic or metal. As another example, inner sidewall 250 and mounting plate 242 of bezel 240 may be separate pieces of plastic or metal, and inner sidewall 250 may be mounted (e.g., fastened, adhered, inference fit, etc.) to mounting plate 242. Thus, inner sidewall 250 may be removable from mounting plate 242. In such a manner, bezel 240 may be mounted to cooktop appliances 100 with or without inner sidewall 250 to provide flexibility and a common bezel between various cooktop appliance configurations. This written description uses examples to disclose the invention, including the best mode, and also to enable any person skilled in the art to practice the invention, including making and using any devices or systems and performing any incorporated methods. The patentable scope of the invention is defined by the claims, and may include other examples that occur to those skilled in the art. Such other examples are intended to be within the scope of the claims if they include structural elements that do not differ from the literal language of the claims, or if they include equivalent structural elements with insubstantial differences from the literal languages of the claims.",
