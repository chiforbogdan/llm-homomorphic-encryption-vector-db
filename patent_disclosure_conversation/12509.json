    "patent_description": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Application 62/105,192 filed Jan. 19, 2015, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD The invention generally relates to banking automation. More specifically, the invention relates to apparatus and methods for managing a budget and facilitating cash flow allocation in order to achieve a prioritized set of financial goals. BACKGROUND Individuals and small business owners often rely on computer-based systems to create a budget, make timely bill payments, maximize investments, and effect various other financial transactions. Using a budget allows individuals and small business owners to set and achieve financial goals. Such financial goals include, for example, retirement, saving for a home purchase, paying for college, and growing a small business. Existing computer-based systems attempt to accommodate an individual's or a small business owner's customized financial goals by providing automated bill payment, budgeting software, and spending alerts. These existing computer-based systems allow a user to amend the budget when financial conditions change, such as an increase or decrease in income, the birth of a new child, a new client, and many others. If a change in financial conditions occurs, and if it is desirable that financial goals of a higher priority are achieved before those of a lower priority, existing systems require the user to amend the budget manually. What is a lacking in the existing computer-based systems is the automatic adjustment of an individual's or a small business owner's budget and cash flows, based on prioritized financial goals, when financial conditions change. An automatic adjustment, without requiring any action from the individual or small business owner, would greatly increase the likelihood that financial goals of a higher priority are met more quickly or at all. Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide individuals and small business owners with a computer-based system for budget automation and financial management that would adjust cash flows on-the-fly, in accordance with a preset prioritized set of financial goals, when financial conditions change. The subject invention is directed to these, as well as other, needs. SUMMARY It is to be understood that both the following general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive, as claimed. Accordingly, in a first aspect, the invention is directed to an apparatus comprising a memory having encoded thereon computer-executable instructions and a processor functionally coupled to the memory and configured, by the computer-executable instructions, to manage a budget for a user, the budget comprising monetary inputs and monetary outputs and data from accounts associated with the monetary inputs and monetary outputs; to organize the monetary outputs into a prioritization schedule; and to apportion the monetary inputs, without action from the user, among the monetary outputs based on the prioritization schedule. In another aspect, the invention is directed to methods of managing a user's budget. The method comprises preparing and storing the budget, which includes the user's monetary inputs and monetary outputs organized into a prioritization schedule. The method further comprises storing data from accounts associated with the monetary inputs and monetary outputs. Finally, the method comprises automatically apportioning, based on the prioritization schedule, the user's monetary inputs among the user's monetary outputs and configuring the monetary output transactions. Additional advantages will be set forth in part in the description that follows or may be learned by practice. The advantages will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive, as claimed.

In an aspect, the apparatus and methods described herein are directed to the management of a user's budget. The user 100 may be, for example, an individual or a small business owner. In an aspect, the apparatus and methods comprise a processor and a memory, which is a computer-readable medium, capable of storing computer-executable instructions, which, when executed by the processor, causes the processor to perform at least the steps or processes described in this disclosure. In at least one embodiment, the apparatus and methods function as a computer-accessible system with a graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d) presented on a display. The GUI is the point of access between the user 100 and the system, and the GUI preferably displays information pertaining to the budget, accounts, monetary inputs and outputs, and other values described below, both in graphical and textual formats. The user 100 preferably registers with the system. In at least one embodiment, registration comprises the user 100 submitting any or all of the following: first name, middle name, last name, physical address, e-mail address, date of birth, gender, occupation, education level, interests, phone numbers, and usernames and passwords for financial account websites associated with the user 100. The system preferably validates any or all of this information. In at least one exemplary embodiment, as depicted in FIG. 1, the user 100 also provides financial information during registration pertaining to monetary inputs 200 and monetary outputs 300. Monetary inputs 200 may include, for example, employment paychecks 205, investment dividends 206, annuities 207, interest from savings accounts 208, accounts receivable, and others currency inflows. Monetary outputs 300 may include, for example, payments to creditors 312, 313, utility payments 307, accounts payable, grocery costs 308, automobile payments, transportation costs 309, housing costs 306, investments, and other currency outflows. For each monetary input 200 or monetary output 300, the user 100 provides any or all of the following: name of financial institution, authorization information, type of account with the financial institution, description of the account, and account number or partial account number. For example, if the financial institution is a bank called BankOne, the authorization information is the user's 100 username and password to access BankOne's website; the type of account is a checking account; the description of the account is \u201cUser's BankOne: All Expenses Paid from Here\u201d; and the account number or partial account number is the checking account number associated with the user's 100 checking account. Many values for these inputs are possible. For example, the type of account may be for savings, a credit card, a loan, retirement, investment, and so on, and the user 100 preferably inputs information for a plurality of accounts. Based on the values the user 100 inputs, the system may request additional information. For example, if the type of account is a 401(k) account, the system may prompt the user 100 to enter the user's marginal tax rate and the user's employer match value in order to calculate a true investment return rate. Once the user 100 enters the information for all accounts associated with the user's monetary inputs 200 and outputs 300, including the authorization information, the information need not be entered again. Rather, the system stores the information securely, and the user 100 logs into the system using the username and password selected during registration for access to information for all of the user's accounts, budget, financial goals, and other information. In an aspect, as depicted in FIG. 2, the system manages a budget for the user 100, the budget comprising the monetary inputs 200 and monetary outputs 300 provided by the user 100. Additionally, the system organizes the monetary inputs 200 and outputs 300 from the budget into a prioritization schedule 500, as depicted in FIGS. 2 and 4, which the system uses to apportion the monetary inputs among the various monetary outputs 602. In an aspect, as depicted in FIG. 4, the system prepares the prioritization schedule 601 by performing the following steps: collecting information from the user to set financial goals 601(a), collecting monetary inputs and outputs from the user 601(b), processing the monetary inputs and outputs 601(c), generating a budget 601(d), and setting the prioritization rules 601(e). In a further aspect, as depicted in FIG. 2, the system organizes the prioritization schedule 500 using an apparatus. The apparatus organizes the prioritization schedule 500 in accordance with financial goals 400 provided by the user 100. For example, if the user 100 desires to purchase a home 402 in the near future and to purchase a car 401 after the home is purchased, the prioritization schedule 500 will include prioritization rules 550 to reflect the home purchase 551 being a higher-priority financial goal than the car purchase. Accordingly, the system would apportion a larger share of the monetary inputs 200 into a financial instrument, account, or security intended for saving for a home purchase 310. By way of illustration, this could include scheduling a transfer of a portion of the monetary inputs 200 into a savings account with a high interest rate yield, a certificate of deposit, treasury bonds, or various other financial instruments. Preferably, the system would use a separate financial instrument, account, or security intended for savings for each savings-based financial goal provided by the user 100. In another example, if the user 100 indicates a desire to pay off credit card debt 404 before paying off a student loan 403, the system would apportion a larger share of the monetary inputs 200 to accounts held by the user 100 associated with credit cards 552 and a smaller share of the monetary inputs 200 would be apportioned to accounts held by the user 100 associated with student loans. Preferably, if several credit card accounts exist, the system would apportion the share of the monetary inputs for paying down credit card debt in a manner to first pay off the credit card account accumulating the largest amount of interest before other credit cards 553. In an aspect, as depicted in FIG. 3, after the system apportions the monetary inputs among the monetary outputs 602, the system then generates a monetary output data set 605 comprising a transaction date, a transfer or payment amount, and the transfer or payment account information for each of the accounts associated with the monetary outputs 300. The system then provides the monetary output data set 605 to a third-party payment processor. The system may provide the monetary output data set 605 via the Internet, encrypted e-mail, or other secure means. Once received by the third-party payment processor, the payments or transfers detailed in the monetary output data set 605 are scheduled and executed by the third-party payment processor 606. Optionally, the system may schedule or execute the payments or transfers within the monetary output data set 605 by accessing the host system of each account via the Internet. Using a series of macros and the credentials provided by the user 100, the system could, for example, access the website of each account's host system and schedule a payment or transfer for a date certain between the user's 100 primary checking account and the payment or transfer account. It is to be understood that the system may schedule or execute the payments or transfers to each of the user's monetary output 300 accounts by other methods not expressly provided herein. In another aspect, the system, without action from the user 100, accesses the accounts provided by the user 100, either during registration or after registration, to update the information held in the system's memory for each account. Such information held in the system's memory for each account may include, for example, the account balance, interest rate, payment due date, investment portfolio, or various other account data pertinent to managing the user's 100 budget. The system may access the accounts daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or at another interval preferred by the user. The system may, for example, access an account via the Internet and use a series of macros to enter the account credentials on the account's website. The system may then use a series of macros to access portions of the website containing information pertinent to the budget, take a screen shot of each accessed page, and store the screen shots in the memory. The screen shots may be analyzed by the system using screen scraping, a technology well-known in the art, to extract relevant account information from the screen shots. The information extracted may then be used by the system to update pertinent information for the respective account. Once the accounts are updated, the system may then update the budget and modify the prioritization schedule 603. For example, if an account associated with one of the user's 100 monetary inputs 200 is a deposit account used for payroll direct deposit by the user's 100 employer, the system may modify the budget and prioritization schedule 603 when an increase in the payroll direct deposit amount is detected. Such an increase could be the result of new employment, a promotion, or a raise. Accordingly, the budget would now have a higher net monetary inflow, and the prioritization schedule could then be modified by the system 603 to permit, for example, quicker attainment of a financial goal 400 of higher priority. Such a financial goal 400 could include, for example, a home purchase 402, set by the user 100 at a higher priority than other savings-related goals 551. The system could modify the prioritization schedule 500 by apportioning a larger share of the monetary inputs 200 to the financial savings instrument associated with the home purchase 310. Optionally, the system could apportion a larger share of the monetary inputs 200 among all of the monetary outputs 300 pro rata. It is to be understood that the system may modify the prioritization schedule 500 in a manner not expressly given as an example herein. Preferably, the system modifies the prioritization schedule 500 without requiring action from the user 100, and, once a modification is performed, the system notifies the user of the modification 604 by SMS, e-mail, pop-up window displayed on the GUI, or other means. The notification 604 may be a textual or graphical representation of the changes made to the budget, which could include, for example, information relating to the originally apportioned share of the monetary inputs 200 for a given monetary output 300 account along with the modified apportionment. In another aspect, as depicted in FIG. 3, at any time the prioritization schedule 500 is modified, either by the user 100 or the system, a new monetary output data set 605 is generated by the system. Once the new monetary output data set 605 is generated, the system may then provide it to a third-party host system 606, as described above, it may access the accounts associated with each monetary output 300 and schedule a transfer or payment, as described above, or the system may take other action in order to effect a transfer or payment for each account included within the monetary output data set 605. In a further aspect, as depicted in FIG. 5, the system aggregates the monetary outputs of the user and the monetary outputs of other users of the system into an aggregated data set. Each of the monetary outputs 300 of the user 100 may be given a unique identifier to differentiate the individual outputs of the user from the aggregated outputs of the other users. The system then classifies each output in the aggregated data set based on a predetermined set of classes retained in the system's memory 607. The classifications may be provided by the financial institutions associated with each monetary output 300. For example, a credit card or debit card provider may classify the user's 100 transactions and make the classified transactions available via the user's 100 account on the provider's website or host system. From the classifications, the system may identify, for example, a particular transaction with a grocery store purchase. The system could then associate the transaction with a category called \u201cfood expenses.\u201d Other categories of monetary outputs could comprise mortgage, rent, utilities, transportation expenses, cell phone expenses, healthcare premiums, credit cards, loans, entertainment, retail shopping, and others. Preferably, the system classifies the monetary outputs 300 without any action from the user 100; however, the user is 100 able to configure the classifications manually if desired. For example, the system may classify a restaurant purchase with the category \u201cfood expenses.\u201d The user 100 may not wish restaurant purchases to be categorized as a food expense, because the user wants to reduce the amount of money spent at restaurants. Therefore, the user 100 could manually change the classification to \u201centertainment expenses,\u201d which may have a lower allocation on the user's budget than \u201cfood expenses.\u201d The system would then classify any future restaurant purchases as an entertainment expense. In another aspect, as depicted in FIG. 5, once the monetary outputs within the aggregated data set are classified 607, the system then analyzes and compares the monetary outputs 300 of the user 100 with the aggregated monetary outputs of other users of the same or similar classification 606. The analysis and comparison performed by the system allows the system to provide the user 100 with recommendations on an alternative product or service 609 when at least one of the monetary outputs 300 of the user 100 differs from the average monetary outputs of other users in the same classification. The term \u201cdiffers\u201d may mean the monetary output 300 of the user is greater than the average monetary output of other users in the same classification. This could include, for example, a cell phone payment. If the user's monthly monetary output 300 to a cell phone carrier is greater than the average monetary output of other users, the system could provide an alert to the user 609, via SMS, e-mail, a pop-up on the GUI, or another method, of the average cost of other users, and it may, for example, provide the user 100 with a promotion from a carrier with a lower average cost. The term \u201cdiffers\u201d could also mean the monetary output 300 of the user 100 is less than the average monetary output of other users in the same classification. This could include, for example, the user's monetary output 300 to a retirement account. If the user's 100 monthly monetary output 300 to a retirement account is less than the average monthly monetary output of other users, the system could provide an alert to the user 609, via SMS, e-mail, a pop-up on the GUI, or another method, of the average monthly retirement contribution of other users. Further, the alert may be provided a second time to the user 610, via SMS, e-mail, a pop-up on the GUI, or another method, at a predetermined time set by the user 100 or the system, reminding the user 100 to take action based on the information provided in the alert 609. In a further aspect, as depicted in FIG. 5, the system provides the user 100 with the following financial metric(s) 611 at a predetermined interval set by the user 100 or the system: credit report and credit score; financial data for tax return preparation; and spending history. The system can provide the user with the financial metric(s) 611 in a variety of methods, including SMS, e-mail, a pop-up on the GUI, or other forms of electronic communication. The credit report and credit score information may include, for example, a graphical representation of the user's credit report, the user's 100 credit score, and related literature. Alternatively, the credit report and credit score information may be provided in a textual format, including, for example, the user's credit report, the user's 100 credit score, and hypertext links to online related literature. The tax return preparation information may include, for example, a graphical or textual representation of the user's 100 summarized monetary inputs 200 and monetary outputs 300 by classification. The spending history may include, for example, a graphical comparison of actual spending amounts versus budgeted spending amounts for a variety of transaction categories over a specified period of time, such as one month, one year, or other periods. Alternatively, the spending history information may be provided in a textual format, including, for example, actual spending amounts, budgeted spending amounts, and an indicator showing whether the actual spending amounts are above or within the budgeted value. It is to be understood that the system may provide other types of information for each of the above categories that is not expressly described herein.
