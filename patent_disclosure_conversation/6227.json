BACKGROUND 1. Field An optical film and a display device are disclosed. 2. Description of the Related Art Commonly used flat panel displays may be classified into light-emitting display devices emitting light by themselves and a non-emissive display devices requiring a separate light source. A compensation film such as a retardation film is frequently employed for improving the image quality thereof. In the case of the light emitting display device, for example, an organic light emitting diode display, the visibility and the contrast ratio may be deteriorated by reflection of exterior light caused by a metal such as an electrode. In order to reduce this, the linear polarized light is changed into circularly polarized light by using a polarizer and a compensation film, so that reflection of the external light by the organic light emitting diode display and leakage thereof to the outside may be prevented. As a solution for solving the external light reflection, the liquid crystal display, which is a non-emissive display device, changes linear polarized light into circularly polarized light to improve the image quality according to the device kind such as transparent, transflective, reflective, and so on. However, a currently-developed optical film has weak durability and may have an influence on quality of a display device, and particularly, cause damage at a place where it is bent or folded.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail, and may be easily performed by those who have common knowledge in the related art. However, this disclosure may be embodied in many different forms, and is not to be construed as limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein. In the drawings, the thickness of layers, films, panels, regions, etc., are exaggerated for clarity. Like reference numerals designate like elements throughout the specification. It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, film, region, or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention. The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d and/or \u201ccomprising,\u201d or \u201cincludes\u201d and/or \u201cincluding\u201d when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. Furthermore, relative terms, such as \u201clower\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201cupper\u201d or \u201ctop,\u201d may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to another element as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as being on the \u201clower\u201d side of other elements would then be oriented on \u201cupper\u201d sides of the other elements. The exemplary term \u201clower,\u201d can therefore, encompasses both an orientation of \u201clower\u201d and \u201cupper,\u201d depending on the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements. The exemplary terms \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below. Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and the present disclosure, and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein. Exemplary embodiments are described herein with reference to cross section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region illustrated or described as flat may, typically, have rough and/or nonlinear features. Moreover, sharp angles that are illustrated may be rounded. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure. All methods described herein can be performed in a suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language (e.g., \u201csuch as\u201d), is intended merely to better illustrate the disclosure and does not pose a limitation on the scope thereof unless otherwise claimed. No language in the specification should be construed as indicating any non-claimed element as essential to the practice of the embodiments as used herein. Hereinafter, an optical film according to an exemplary embodiment is described referring to the drawings. FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view showing an optical film according to an exemplary embodiment. Referring to FIG. 1, an optical film 300 includes a polarization film 110, a first phase delay layer 120a, a second phase delay layer 120b, a first adhesive 115a between the polarization film 110 and the first phase delay layer 120a, and a second adhesive 115b between the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b. The first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may have different in-phase retardation from each other. For example one of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may have in-phase retardation of about 230 nm to about 300 nm and the other may have in-phase retardation of about 110 nm to about 160 nm for a 550 nm wavelength (hereinafter referred to as \u2018reference wavelength\u2019). For example, in-phase retardation of the first phase delay layer 120a for the reference wavelength may be about 230 nm to about 300 nm and in-phase retardation of the second phase delay layer 120b for the reference wavelength may be about 110 nm to about 160 nm. For example, one of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may be a \u03bb/2 phase delay layer and the other may be a \u03bb/4 phase delay layer. For example, the first phase delay layer 120a may be a \u03bb/2 phase delay layer and the second phase delay layer 120b may be a \u03bb/4 phase delay layer. The first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may circularly-polarize light having passed through the polarization film 110 to generate phase difference, and may influence reflection and/or absorption of light. For example, the optical film 300 may be disposed on one side or both sides of a display device, and particularly on the screen side of the display device, and thus may prevent reflection of light flowing in from the outside (hereinafter referred to as \u201cexternal light\u201d). Therefore, the optical film 300 may prevent visibility deterioration due to the reflection of external light. FIG. 2 is a schematic view showing the external light anti-reflection principle of an optical film. Referring to FIG. 2, while the incident unpolarized light having entered from the outside is passed through the polarization film 110, and the polarized light is shifted into circularly polarized light by passing through the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b, only a first polarized perpendicular component, which is one polarized perpendicular component of two polarized perpendicular components, is transmitted. While the circularly polarized light is reflected in a display panel 50 including a substrate, an electrode, and so on, and changes the circular polarization direction, and the circularly polarized light is passed through the second phase delay layer 120b and the first phase delay layer 120a again, only a second polarized perpendicular component, which is the other polarized perpendicular component of the two polarized perpendicular components, may be transmitted. As the second polarized perpendicular component is not passed through the polarization film 110, and light does not exit to the outside, effects of preventing the external light reflection may be provided. FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional schematic view showing a polarization film in the optical film of FIG. 1. Referring to FIG. 3, the polarization film 110 may be an elongation film made of a melt blend of a polyolefin 71 and a dichroic dye 72. The polyolefin 71 may be, for example, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), a copolymer of polyethylene and polypropylene (PE-PP), or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. For another example, the polyolefin 71 may be a mixture of polypropylene (PP) and a polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer (PE-PP). The polypropylene (PP) may have, for example, a melt flow index (MFI) of about 0.1 grams per 10 minutes (g/10 min) to about 5 g/10 min. As used herein, the melt flow index (MFI) shows the amount of a polymer in a melt state flowing per 10 min, and relates to viscosity of the polyolefin in a molten state. In other words, as the melt flow index (MFI) is lower, the polyolefin has higher viscosity, while as the melt flow index (MFI) is higher, the polyolefin has lower viscosity. When the polypropylene (PP) has a melt flow index (MFI) within the above described range, properties of a final product as well as workability may be effectively improved. Specifically, the polypropylene may have a melt flow index (MFI) ranging from about 0.5 g/10 min to about 5 g/10 min. The polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer (PE-PP) may include about 1 wt % to about 50 wt % of an ethylene group based on the total amount of the copolymer. When the polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer (PE-PP) includes an amount of the ethylene group within this range, phase separation of the polypropylene and the polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer (PE-PP) may be effectively prevented or suppressed. In addition, the polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer (PE-PP) may improve an elongation rate during elongation as well as have excellent light transmittance and alignment, improving polarization characteristics. Specifically, the polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer (PE-PP) may include an ethylene group in an amount of about 1 wt % to about 25 wt % based on the total amount of the copolymer. The polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer (PE-PP) may have a melt flow index (MFI) ranging from about 5 g/10 min to about 15 g/10 min. When the polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer (PE-PP) has a melt flow index (MFI) within the range, properties of a final product as well as workability may be effectively improved. Specifically, the polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer (PE-PP) may have a melt flow index (MFI) ranging from about 10 g/10 min to about 15 g/10 min. The polyolefin 71 may include a polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer (PE-PP) in a weight ratio of about 1:9 to about 9:1. When the polypropylene (PP) and the polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer (PE-PP) are included within this range, the polypropylene may be prevented from crystallizing and may have excellent mechanical strength, thus effectively improving the haze characteristics. Specifically, the polyolefin 71 may include the polypropylene (PP) and the polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer (PE-PP) in a weight ratio of about 4:6 to about 6:4, and specifically, in a weight ratio of about 5:5. The polyolefin 71 may have a melt flow index (MFI) ranging from about 1 g/10 min to about 15 g/10 min. When the polyolefin 71 has a melt flow index (MFI) within this range, the polyolefin resin may not only secure excellent light transmittance since crystals are not excessively formed in the resin, but may also have appropriate viscosity for manufacturing a film and thus have improved workability. Specifically, the polyolefin 71 may have a melt flow index (MFI) ranging from about 5 g/10 min to about 15 g/10 min. The polyolefin 71 may have haze ranging from less than or equal to about 5%. When the polyolefin 71 has haze within this range, transmittance may be increased, and thus excellent optical properties may be secured. Specifically, the polyolefin 71 may have haze of less than or equal to about 2%, and more specifically, about 0.5% to about 2%. The polyolefin 71 may have crystallinity of less than or equal to about 50%. When the polyolefin 71 has crystallinity within this range, the polyolefin resin may have lower haze and accomplish excellent optical properties. For example, the polyolefin 71 may have crystallinity of about 30% to about 50%. The polyolefin 71 may have transmittance of greater than or equal to about 85% in a wavelength region of about 400 to about 780 nm. The polyolefin 71 may be elongated in a uniaxial direction. The direction may be the length direction of the dichroic dye 72. The dichroic dye 72 is dispersed in the polyolefin 71 and aligned in the elongation direction of the polyolefin 71. The dichroic dye 72 transmits one perpendicular polarization component out of two perpendicular polarization components in a predetermined wavelength region. The dichroic dye 72 may be included in an amount of about 0.01 to about 5 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyolefin 71. Within this range, sufficient polarization characteristics may be obtained without deteriorating transmittance of a polarization film. Within the above range, the dichroic dye 72 may be included in an amount of about 0.05 to about 1 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyolefin 71. The polarization film 110 may have a dichroic ratio of about 2 to about 14 at a maximum absorption wavelength (\u03bbmax) in a visible ray region. Within the range, the dichroic ratio may be about 3 to about 10. Herein, the dichroic ratio is a value obtained by dividing linear polarization absorption in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the polymer by polarization absorption in a direction parallel to the polymer, and may be obtained by Equation 1. DR=Log(1/T\u22a5)/Log(1/T//) [Equation 1] In Equation 1, DR is a dichroic ratio of a polarization film, T// is light transmittance of light entering parallel to the transmissive axis of a polarization film, and T\u22a5 is light transmittance of light entering perpendicular to the transmissive axis of the polarization film. The dichroic ratio denotes a degree that the dichroic dye 72 is aligned in one direction in the polarization film 110. The polarization film 110 has a dichroic ratio within the range in a visible ray wavelength region, which leads the dichroic dye 72 to be aligned along the alignment of a polyolefin chain, and thus may improve the polarizing characteristics. The polarization film 110 may have polarization efficiency of greater than or equal to about 80%, and within the range, about 83 to about 99.9%. Herein, the polarization efficiency may be obtained by Equation 2. PE (%)=[(T//\u2212T\u22a5/(T//+T\u22a5]1/2*100 [Equation 2] In Equation 2, PE is polarization efficiency, T\u2225 is light transmittance of the polarization film regarding light parallel to the transmissive axis of the polarization film, and T\u22a5 is light transmittance of the polarization film regarding light perpendicular to the transmissive axis of the polarization film. The polarization film 110 may have a relatively thin thickness of less than or equal to about 100 \u03bcm, for example, about 30 \u03bcm to about 95 \u03bcm. When the polarization film 110 has a thickness with the range, the polarization film 110 is relatively thinner than a polyvinyl alcohol polarizing plate requiring a protective layer such as triacetyl cellulose (TAC), and thus may realize a thin display device. The first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may be, for example, an anisotropic liquid crystal layer including each liquid crystal. The liquid crystal may have a rigid-rod or wide disk shape that is aligned in one direction, and may be, for example, a monomer, an oligomer, and/or a polymer. The liquid crystal may be a reactive mesogenic liquid crystal, and may have, for example, at least one reactive cross-linking group. The reactive mesogenic liquid crystal may include at least one of, for example, a rod-shaped aromatic derivative having at least one reactive cross-linking group, propylene glycol 1-methyl, propylene glycol 2-acetate, and a compound represented by P1-A1-(Z1-A2)n-P2 (wherein P1 and P2 independently include acrylate, methacrylate, vinyl, vinyloxy, epoxy, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing, A1 and A2 independently include a 1,4-phenylene, naphthalene-2,6-diyl group, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing, Z1 includes a single bond, \u2014COO\u2014, \u2014OCO\u2014, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing, and n is 0, 1, or 2), but is not limited thereto. The liquid crystals of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may independently have positive or negative birefringence (\u0394n). The birefringence (\u0394n) is a difference found by subtracting the refractive index (no) of light propagating perpendicular to an optical axis from the refractive index (ne) of light propagating parallel to the optical axis. The liquid crystal may be aligned in one direction along the optical axis. For example, the liquid crystals of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may have respective refractive indices satisfying Relationship Equation 1A or 1B. nx>ny=nz [Relationship Equation 1A] nx<ny=nz [Relationship Equation 1B] In Relationship Equations 1A and 1B, nx is a refractive index at a slow axis of the first phase delay layer and the second phase delay layer, ny is a refractive index at a fast axis of the first phase delay layer and the second phase delay layer, and nz is a refractive index in the direction perpendicular to nx and ny. For example, each liquid crystal of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may have a refractive index satisfying Relationship Equation 1A. For example, each liquid crystal of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may have a refractive index satisfying Relationship Equation 1B. For example, the liquid crystal of the first phase delay layer 120a may have a refractive index satisfying Relationship Equation 1A and the liquid crystal of the second phase delay layer 120b may have a refractive index satisfying Relationship Equation 1B. For example, the liquid crystal of the first phase delay layer 120a may have a refractive index satisfying Relationship Equation 1B and the liquid crystal of the second phase delay layer 120b may have a refractive index satisfying Relationship Equation 1A. The first phase delay layer 120a and second phase delay layer 120b may each have forward wavelength dispersion phase delay, and a combination of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may have an inverse wavelength dispersion phase delay. The forward wavelength dispersion phase delay has higher retardation of light having a short wavelength than retardation of light having a long wavelength, and the reverse wavelength dispersion phase delay has higher retardation of light having a long wavelength than retardation of light having a short wavelength. The phase delay may be represented by in-phase retardation, in-phase retardation (Re1) of the first phase delay layer 120a may be represented by Re1=(nx1\u2212ny1)d1, in-phase retardation (Re2) of the second phase delay layer 120b may be represented by Re2=(n2\u2212ny2)d2, and the entire in-phase retardation (Re0) of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may be represented by Re0=(nx0\u2212ny0)d0. Herein, nx1 is a refractive index at a slow axis of the first phase delay layer 120a, ny1 is a refractive index at a fast axis of the first phase delay layer 120a, d1 is a thickness of the first phase delay layer 120a, nx2 is a refractive index at a slow axis of the second phase delay layer 120b, ny2 is a refractive index at a fast axis of the second phase delay layer 120b, d2 is a thickness of the second phase delay layer 120b, nx0 is a refractive index at a slow axis of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b, ny0 is a refractive index at a fast axis of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b, and d0 is a thickness of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b. Accordingly, the in-plane retardation (Re1 and Re2) may be provided within a predetermined range by changing refractive indices at the slow axis and/or the fast axis and/or thicknesses of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b. For example, in-phase retardation (Re1) for a reference wavelength of the first phase delay layer 120a may be about 230 nm to about 300 nm, in-phase retardation (Re2) for a reference wavelength of the second phase delay layer 120b may be about 110 nm to about 160 nm, and entire in-phase retardation of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b for incident light having a reference wavelength may be the difference between the in-plane retardation (Re1) of the first phase delay layer 120a and the in-plane retardation (Re2) of the second phase delay layer 120b. For example, the entire in-phase retardation (Re0) of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b for incident light of a reference wavelength may be about 110 nm to about 160 nm. In the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b, the retardation of light having a short wavelength may be higher than the retardation of light having a long wavelength as described above. For example, for the wavelengths of 450 nm, 550 nm, and 650 nm, the in-plane retardation (Re1) of the first phase delay layer 120a may satisfy Re1 (450 nm)\u2267Re1 (550 nm)>Re1 (650 nm) or Re1 (450 nm)>Re1 (550 nm)\u2267Re1 (650 nm), and the in-plane retardation (Re2) of the second phase delay layer 120b may satisfy Re2 (450 nm)>Re2 (550 nm)>Re2 (650 nm). The combination of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may have higher retardation of light having a long wavelength than the retardation of light having a short wavelength as described above. For example, the in-phase retardation (Re0) of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b at 450 nm, 550 nm, and 650 nm wavelengths may satisfy Re0 (450 nm)\u2266Re0 (550 nm)<Re0 (650 nm) or Re0 (450 nm)<Re0 (550 nm)\u2266Re0 (650 nm). The changing of the retardation of the short wavelength for the reference wavelength may be represented by short wavelength dispersion, the short wavelength dispersion of the first phase delay layer 120a may be represented by Re1 (450 nm)/Re1 (550 nm), and the short wavelength dispersion of the second phase delay layer 120b may be represented by Re2 (450 nm)/Re2 (550 nm). For example, the short wavelength dispersion of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may independently be about 1.1 to about 1.2, and the entire short wavelength dispersion of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may be about 0.70 to about 0.99. The changing of the retardation of the long wavelength for the reference wavelength may be represented by long wavelength dispersion, the long wavelength dispersion of the first phase delay layer 120a may be represented by Re1 (650 nm)/Re1 (550 nm), and the long wavelength dispersion of the second phase delay layer 120b may be represented by Re2 (650 nm)/Re2 (550 nm). For example, the long wavelength dispersion of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may independently be about 0.9 to about 1.0, and the entire long wavelength dispersion of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may be about 1.01 to about 1.20. On the other hand, the thickness direction retardation (Rth1) of the first phase delay layer 120a may be represented by Rth1={[(nx1+ny1)/2]\u2212nz1}d1, the thickness direction retardation (Rth2) of the second phase delay layer 120b may be represented by Rth2={[(nx2+ny2)/2]\u2212nz2}d2, and the thickness direction retardation (Rth0) of the combined first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may be represented by Rth0={[(nx0+ny0)/2]\u2212nz0}d0. Herein, nx1 is a refractive index at a slow axis of the first phase delay layer 120a, ny1 is a refractive index at a fast axis of the first phase delay layer 120a, nz1 is a refractive index in a direction perpendicular to nx1 and ny1, nx2 is a refractive index at a slow axis of the second phase delay layer 120b, ny2 is a refractive index at a fast axis of the second phase delay layer 120b, nz2 is a refractive index in a direction perpendicular to nx2 and ny2, nx0 is a refractive index at a slow axis of the combined first and second phase delay layer 120a and 120b, ny0 is a refractive index at a fast axis of the combined first and second phase delay layers 120a and 120b, and nz0 is a refractive index in a direction perpendicular to nx0 and ny0. The thickness direction retardation (Rth0) of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may be the sum of the thickness direction retardation (Rth1) of the first phase delay layer 120a and the thickness direction retardation (Rth2) of the second phase delay layer 120b. For example, the thickness direction retardation (Rth0) of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b for a reference wavelength may be about \u2212250 nm to about 250 nm. The first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may each have a thickness of less than or equal to about 5 \u03bcm. For example, the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may each have a thickness of about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 5 \u03bcm. For example, the sum of the thicknesses of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may be about 1 \u03bcm to about 10 \u03bcm, for example about 2 \u03bcm to about 8 \u03bcm. In this way, the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may have remarkably reduced thickness compared with a conventional polymer phase delay layer, and thereby may reduce the thickness of the optical film 300. Accordingly, a display device including the optical film 300 may also have a reduced thickness and a thin display device may be realized. Each of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may be thinner than the first and second adhesives 115a and 115b which will be described later. The first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may be formed by applying a liquid crystal solution on a substrate. Herein, the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may be formed on respective substrates or may be sequentially formed on one substrate. The substrate may be, for example, a triacetyl cellulose (TAC) film, but is not limited thereto. The liquid crystal solution may include a liquid crystal and a solvent such as toluene, xylene, cyclohexanone, and the like, and the solution may be, for example, applied on the transparent substrate with a solution process such as spin coating, bar coating, slit coating, or inkjet coating. Subsequently, the liquid crystal solution may be further dried, and for example, the liquid crystal is cured with UV. The first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b having controlled optical properties are respectively prepared, and are assembled to realize a reverse wavelength dispersion delay and to show \u03bb/4 retardation in a full visible ray region. Accordingly, the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may effectively realize a compensation function of circularly polarized light and form an optical film with the polarization film 110 to improve display characteristics of a display device. The polarization film 110 and the first phase delay layer 120a, and the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b, may be bound with each other by intervening the first and second adhesives 115a and 115b. The first and second adhesives 115a and 115b may be, for example, a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA). The first and second adhesives 115a and 115b may be a composition including an adhesive resin or a cured product thereof. The adhesive resin may include, for example a (meth)acrylic resin, a urethane resin, a polyisobutylene resin, a styrene butadiene rubber, a polyvinylether resin, an epoxy resin, a melamine resin, a polyester resin, a phenolic resin, a silicone resin, a derivative thereof, a copolymer thereof, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing, but is not limited thereto. The adhesive resin may be, for example, synthesized from at least one monomer and/or oligomer, a reaction initiator, and a cross-linking agent. The monomer and/or oligomer may include, for example, alkyl(meth)acrylate, but is not limited thereto. The reaction initiator may be, for example, benzoyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, potassium persulfonate, 2,2\u2032-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing, but is not limited thereto. The cross-linking agent may be, for example, an isocyanate compound, an epoxy compound, an aziridine compound, a metal chelate compound, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing, but is not limited thereto. The adhesive resin may have, for example, a hydroxy group, a carboxyl group, a nitrogen-containing functional group, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. The adhesive resin may have, for example, a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of about 500,000 to about 1,800,000, for example about 600,000 to 1,500,000. The first and second adhesives 115a and 115b may each have, for example, a thickness of about 5 \u03bcm to about 25 \u03bcm. The first and second adhesives 115a and 115b may each have, for example, a thickness of about 5 \u03bcm to about 12 \u03bcm. The first and/or second adhesives 115a and 115b have a storage modulus of greater than or equal to about 0.2 MPa at room temperature (25\u00b0 C.) of at a frequency of 10 Hz. As described above, the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may have an ultrathin thickness of about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 5 \u03bcm. Each thickness of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may be smaller than the thickness of the first or second adhesives 115a and 115b, and for example, each thickness of the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b may be about 0.05 to about 0.8 times a thickness of the first or second adhesives 115a and 115b. Durability of the thin first and second phase delay layers 120a and 120b is improved by adjusting the storage modulus of the first and/or second adhesives 115a and 115b contacting the first and/or second phase delay layers 120a and 120b. In other words, when the first and/or second adhesives 115a and 115b have a storage modulus of greater than or equal to about 0.2 MPa, the thin first and/or second phase delay layers 120a and 120b are less likely to crack and/or a wrinkle. Furthermore, when the first and/or second adhesives 115a and 115b have a storage modulus of greater than or equal to about 0.2 MPa, the first and/or second phase delay layers 120a and 120b are much less likely to crack and/or a wrinkle where the optical film 300 is bent or folded. Accordingly, since the external deformation of the optical film 300 may be reduced, the optical film may be effectively applied to a flexible display device such as a foldable or bendable display device and improve characteristics of a display device including the optical film 300. The storage modulus of the first and/or second adhesives 115a and 115b may be about 0.2 MPa to about 8 GPa, or about 0.7 MPa to about 8 GPa. The first and/or second adhesives 115a and 115b may have a 180\u00b0 peel force of greater than or equal to about 1500 gf/25 mm at room temperature for the first phase delay layer 120a or the second phase delay layer 120b. Herein, the 180\u00b0 peel force is an index for evaluating adherence between the first or second phase delay layer 120a or 120b and the first and/or second adhesives 115a and/or 115b and is determined after folding a polymer film up to 180\u00b0 after curing a sample sequentially consisting of the first or second phase delay layer 120a or 120b, the first and/or second adhesive 115a and/or 115b, and the polymer film. The 90\u00b0 peel force may be about 1500 gf/25 mm to about 5000 gf/25 mm. The optical film 300 may further include a correction layer (not shown). The correction layer may be, for example, a color shift resistant layer, but is not limited thereto. The optical film 300 may further include a light-blocking layer (not shown) spreading out along the edge. The light-blocking layer may be formed as a band along the circumference of the optical film 300, for example, positioned between the polarization film 110 and the first phase delay layer 120a. The light-blocking layer may include an opaque material, for example, a black material. For example, the light-blocking layer may be made of a black ink. As described above, the optical film 300 according to the present embodiment may accomplish the reverse wavelength dispersion delay by assembling the first phase delay layer 120a and the second phase delay layer 120b having controlled optical properties, and may provide \u03bb/4 retardation in the entire visible ray region. Accordingly, the first and second phase delay layers 120a and 120b may effectively accomplish the circularly polarized compensation function and may improve the display characteristics of the display device by forming an optical film with the polarization film 110. In addition, the optical film 300 may become much thinner by using the thin first and second phase delay layers 120a and 120b. Accordingly, the optical film 300 is applied to realize a thin display device. In addition, the storage modulus of the first and/or second adhesives 115a and/or 115b contacting the first and/or second phase delay layers 120a and/or 120b may be adjusted to reduce generation of a crack or a wrinkle in the first and second phase delay layers 120a and 120b and secure durability. Accordingly, the optical film 300 may improve characteristics of a display device. In addition, the first and second phase delay layers 120a and 120b secure durability, have much less cracks or wrinkles where the optical film 300 is folded or bent, and accordingly, the optical film 300 may be effectively applied to a flexible display device such as a foldable display device or a bendable display device. The optical film 300 may be applied to various display devices. A display device includes a display panel and an optical film positioned on one side of the display panel. The display panel may be a liquid crystal panel or organic light emitting panel, but is not limited thereto. Hereinafter, an organic light emitting display is described as one example of a display device. FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view showing an exemplary example of an organic light emitting display. Referring to FIG. 4, the organic light emitting display includes an organic light emitting display panel 400 and an optical film 300 positioned on one side of the organic light emitting display panel 400. The organic light emitting display panel 400 may include a base substrate 410, a lower electrode 420, an organic emission layer 430, an upper electrode 440, and an encapsulation substrate 450. The base substrate 410 may be made of glass or plastic. At least one of the lower electrode 420 and the upper electrode 440 may be an anode, and the other one may be a cathode. The anode is an electrode injected with holes, and may be made of a transparent conductive material having a high work function to transmit the emitted light to the outside, for example, indium tin oxide (ITO) or indium zinc oxide (IZO). The cathode is an electrode injected with electrons, and may be made of a conductive material having a low work function and not affecting the organic material, and may be selected from, for example, aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), and barium (Ba). The organic emission layer 430 includes an organic material which may emit light when applying a voltage to the lower electrode 420 and the upper electrode 440. An auxiliary layer (not shown) may be further provided between the lower electrode 420 and the organic emission layer 430 and between the upper electrode 440 and the organic emission layer 430. The auxiliary layer is used to balance electrons and holes, and may include a hole transport layer, a hole injection layer (HIL), an electron injection layer (EIL), and an electron transporting layer. The encapsulation substrate 450 may be made of glass, metal, or a polymer, and may seal the lower electrode 420, the organic emission layer 430, and the upper electrode 440 to prevent moisture and/or oxygen inflow from the outside. The organic light emitting display panel 400 may be a flexible display panel. The optical film 300 may be disposed on the light-emitting side. For example, in the case of a bottom emission structure emitting light at the side of the base substrate 410, the optical film 100 may be disposed on the exterior side of the base substrate 410, while in the case of a top emission structure emitting light at the side of the encapsulation substrate 450, the optical film 100 may be disposed on the exterior side of the encapsulation substrate 450. As described above, the optical film 300 includes the polarization film 110 that is self-integrated and formed of a melt blend of a polyolefin and a dichroic dye, the first and second phase delay layers 120a and 120b that are liquid crystal anisotropic layers, and the first and second adhesives 115a and 115b. The polarization film 110, the first and second phase delay layers 120a and 120b, and the first and second adhesive 115a and 115b are respectively the same as described above, and may prevent a display device from having visibility deterioration caused by light inflowing from the outside after passing the polarization film 110 and being reflected by a metal such as an electrode and the like in the organic light emitting display panel 400. Accordingly, display characteristics of the organic light emitting display may be improved. Hereinafter, a liquid crystal display (LCD) is described as an exemplary example of the display device. FIG. 5 is a schematic cross-sectional view showing an exemplary liquid crystal display. Referring to FIG. 5, the liquid crystal display (LCD) includes a liquid crystal display panel 500, and an optical film 100 positioned on one side of the liquid crystal panel 500. The liquid crystal panel 500 may be a twist nematic (TN) mode panel, a vertical alignment (PVA) mode panel, an in-plane switching (IPS) mode panel, an optically compensated bend (OCB) mode panel, or the like. The liquid crystal panel 500 may include a first display panel 510, a second display panel 520, and a liquid crystal layer 530 interposed between the first display panel 510 and the second display panel 520. The first display panel 510 may include, for example, a thin film transistor (not shown) formed on a substrate (not shown) and a first electric field generating electrode (not shown) connected to the same, and the second display panel 520 may include, for example, a color filter (not shown) formed on a substrate (not shown) and a second electric field generating electrode (not shown). However, it is not limited thereto, and the color filter may be included in the first display panel 510, while the first electric field generating electrode and the second electric field generating electrode may be disposed on the first display panel 510 together therewith. The liquid crystal layer 530 may include a plurality of liquid crystal molecules. The liquid crystal molecules may have positive or negative dielectric anisotropy. In the case of the liquid crystal molecules having positive dielectric anisotropy, the major axes thereof may be aligned substantially parallel to the surface of the first display panel 510 and the second display panel 520 when not applying an electric field, and the major axes may be aligned substantially perpendicular to the surface of the first display panel 510 and second display panel 520 when applying an electric field. On the other hand, in the case of the liquid crystal molecules having negative dielectric anisotropy, the major axes may be aligned substantially perpendicular to the surface of the first display panel 510 and the second display panel 520 when not applying an electric field, and the major axes may be aligned substantially parallel to the surface of the first display panel 510 and the second display panel 520 when applying an electric field. The liquid crystal panel 500 may be a flexible display panel. The optical film 300 includes the polarization film 110 that is self-integrated and formed of a melt blend of a polyolefin and a dichroic dye, the first and second phase delay layers 120a and 120b that are liquid crystal anisotropic layers, and the first and second adhesives 115a and 115b, which are the same as described above. The optical film 300 may be disposed on the outside of the liquid crystal panel 500. Although the optical film 100 is shown to be provided on both the lower part and the upper part of the liquid crystal panel 500 in the drawing, it is not limited thereto, and it may be formed on only one of the lower part and the upper part of the liquid crystal panel 500. Hereinafter, the present disclosure is illustrated in more detail with reference to examples. However, these examples are exemplary, and the present disclosure is not limited thereto. Manufacture of Polarization Film Preparation Example 1 A composition for a polarization film is prepared by mixing a polyolefin including polypropylene (PP) (HU300, Samsung Total Petrochemicals Co., Ltd.) and a polypropylene-polyethylene copolymer (PP-PE) (RJ581, Samsung Total Petrochemicals Co., Ltd.) in a ratio of 5:5 (w/w) and dichroic dyes represented by the following Chemical Formulas A, B, and C in an amount of 0.5, 0.2, and 0.3 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polyolefin respectively. The composition for a polarization film is melt-blended at about 250\u00b0 C. by using a micro-compounder made by DSM. The melt mixture is put in a sheet-shaped mold and pressed with high temperature and pressure, forming a film.

Example 6 An optical film is manufactured according to the same method as Example 5, except for using the adhesive of Preparation Example 6 instead of the adhesive of Preparation Example 5. Example 7 An optical film is manufactured according to the same method as Example 5, except for using the adhesive of Preparation Example 8 instead of the adhesive of Preparation Example 5. Comparative Example 1 An optical film is manufactured according to the same method as Example 5, except for using the adhesive of Preparation Example 8 instead of the adhesive of Preparation Example 5. Evaluation 3: High Temperature Durability 1 High temperature durability of the optical films according to Examples 5 to 7 and Comparative Example 1 is evaluated. The high temperature durability is evaluated by examining whether a place where the optical films are folded is deformed and/or damaged in a static bending test. The static bending test is performed by folding each optical film according to Examples 5 to 7 and Comparative Example 1 to have a curvature radius (r) of 3 mm, fixing it between two stainless steel plates, allowing it to stand at 85\u00b0 C. for 240 h, and unfolding it to examine whether the folded place is deformed or not. The results are provided in FIGS. 6 to 9. FIG. 6 is a photograph showing the appearance of the optical film of Example 5 attached to a reflector after performing a bending test. FIG. 7 is a photograph showing the appearance of the optical film of Example 6 attached to a reflector after performing a bending test. FIG. 8 is a photograph showing the appearance of the optical film of Example 7 attached to a reflector after performing a bending test. FIG. 9 is a photograph showing the appearance of the optical film of Comparative Example 1 attached to a reflector after performing a bending test. Referring to FIGS. 6 to 9, the optical films according to Examples 5 to 7 show no crack or wrinkle in the folded place, while the optical film according to Comparative Example 1 show many cracks and wrinkles along a diagonal line in the folded place. Accordingly, the optical films according to Examples 5 to 7 show satisfactory high temperature durability without appearance deformation. Evaluation 4: High Temperature Durability 2 The phase difference change of the optical films according to Example 5 and Comparative Example 1 is examined after the above static bending test. The initial phase difference of the optical films before the static bending test and their phase difference after the static bending test are measured by using optical measurement equipment (KOBRA) to obtain their phase difference changes. The results are provided in Table 4. TABLE 4 Phase difference change Example 5 1.90 Comparative Example 1 2.60 Referring to Table 4, the optical film according to Example 5 has a phase difference change of less than 2.0, while the optical film according to Comparative Example 1 has a large phase difference change of greater than or equal to 2.5 at the folded place. Specifically, the optical film of Example 5 shows a phase difference change of about 30% compared with the optical film according to Comparative Example 1. Accordingly, the optical film of Example 5 has a small optical property change and thus has satisfactory high temperature durability. While this disclosure has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be practical exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.",
