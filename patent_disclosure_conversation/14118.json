DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the attached drawings. However, these are illustrative only, and the scope of the present invention is not limited thereto. Overview of System for Sharing Screen 1 The overview of the present invention will be described below with reference to FIG. 1. The screen sharing system 1 includes an operator terminal 100 and a destination terminal 200. In these embodiments, the system including an operator terminal 100 and a destination terminal 200 will be explained. However, this does not necessarily mean that the system includes a plurality of terminals that have functions different from each other. The system may be a plurality of terminals that have the same functions as each other. The operator terminal 100 may be connected with the destination terminal 200 through a server device. First, communication is established between the operator terminal 100 and the destination terminal 200 to share a screen (step S01). The operator terminal 100 receives screen data of the destination terminal 200 and displays the received screen data in the shared area. For example, in the step S01, during a call such as a video-phone call or while a special application is running, the operator terminal 100 transmits a transmission request of screen data showing a screen content to the destination terminal 200, and then the destination terminal 200 receives this transmission request and starts to transmit screen data to the operator terminal 100 based on this transmission request. If detecting a predetermined input or operation in the shared area, the operator terminal 100 transmits request data to request a change of the area corresponding to the received input or the detected movement to the destination terminal 200 (step S02). In the step S02, the predetermined input is to specify a predetermined area in the shared area and to receive an operation in the shared area. In the step S02, examples of the operation in the shared area include zoom-in, zoom-out, rotating, and scrolling operations. In the step S02, the detection of a predetermined movement is to detect an area moving in the shared area. Examples of the change of an area include changing the resolution and the display magnification; rotating and scrolling the screen; and changing a moving image to a still image and a still image to a moving image. The destination terminal 200 receives the request data and transmits the response data responding to the request (step S03). Examples of the response data include screen data in which resolution and display magnification are changed; screen data in rotated and scrolled screen data; and screen data in which a moving image is changed to a still image and in which a still image is changed to a moving image. In the step S03, the destination terminal 200 transmits response data through a communication channel different from that transmitting screen data in the step S01. For example, the communication channel at this time transmits response data to the operator terminal 100 as a packet different from that of the screen data transmitted in the step S01. The operator terminal 100 receives the response data and changes and displays the area corresponding to the received predetermined input or the detected predetermined movement based on the response data (step S04). In the step S04, the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display screen data changed based on the response data in the shared screen displayed inside or outside the shared area. In step S04, examples of the screen data changed based on the response data that the operator terminal 100 displays include screen data in which resolution and display magnification are changed to higher or lower; rotated and scrolled screen data; and screen data in which a moving image is changed to a still image and in which a still image is changed to a moving image. According to the above-mentioned system configuration, the screen sharing system 1 can devote the communication band to an important part to dynamically transmit the compression ratio and the resolution of the image that used to be transmitted at a uniform rate per image, at a high resolution compared with other areas. Furthermore, during a call such as a video-phone call or while a special application is running, the screen sharing system 1 can transmits only a specified area, a zoomed-in area at a high resolution; not a moving image but a high-resolution still image that is automatically taken, when a moving image is zoomed-in; and a high-resolution moving image in which still images are continuously taken.

Screen Sharing Process in First Embodiment FIG. 4 is a flow chart of the screen sharing process executed by the operator terminal 100 and the destination terminal 200 in the first embodiment. The tasks executed by the modules of the above-mentioned devices are explained below together with this process. As described above, the operator terminal 100 and the destination terminal 200 may not have functions different from each other and may have the same functions as each other. The operator terminal 100 may have functions of the destination terminal 200 and vice versa. First, the application module 150 of the operator terminal 100 starts an application involved in screen sharing (step S10). The connection request transmitting module 140 of the operator terminal 100 transmits a connection request to the destination terminal 200 to establish network connection necessary for screen sharing (step S11). The connection request receiving module 240 of the destination terminal 200 receives the connection request transmitted from the operator terminal 100. The screen data transfer module 241 of the destination terminal 200 starts network connection with the operator terminal 100 based on the connection request and transmits a screen content displayed on the destination terminal 200 itself to the operator terminal 100 as shared screen data (step S12). The screen data transfer module 141 of the operator terminal 100 receives the shared screen data transmitted from the destination terminal 200. The shared screen display module 151 of the operator terminal 100 displays the received shared screen data in a shared area 300 shown in FIG. 7 (step S13). FIG. 7 shows a shared area 300 displayed by the shared screen display module 151 of the operator terminal 100. In FIG. 7, the shared screen display module 151 displays the shared screen data transmitted from the destination terminal 200 in the shared area 300. The input receiving module 152 of the operator terminal 100 receives a specified area of a predetermined area in the shared area 300. Then, the input receiving module 152 of the operator terminal 100 judges whether or not the input receiving module 152 receives a specified area of a predetermined area in the shared area 300. In the step S14, the input receiving module 152 judges whether or not the input receiving module 152 receives an input of a specifying line 310 shown in FIG. 8. The specifying line 310 is not limited to a rectangle and may be other shapes such as a circle, a dot, a straight line, and a curve. The specifying line 310 capable of specifying an area should be enough. In the step S14, if judging that the input receiving module 152 does not receive an input of a specified area (NO), the input receiving module 152 of the operator terminal 100 repeats this step until receiving an input. On the other hand, if the input receiving module 152 judges that the input receiving module 152 receives an input of a specified area (YES) in the step S14, the request data generation module 153 of the operator terminal 100 generates request data to request a change of the area corresponding to the received input (step S15). In this embodiment, the request data generation module 153 generates request data to change the resolution of shared screen data of the area corresponding to the received input to a higher resolution in the step S15. The request data generation module 153 may generate request data to change the resolution of shared screen data to a lower resolution. The request data generation module 153 may also generate request data to request a change of frame per second (hereinafter referred to as \u201cFPS\u201d). The request data generation module 153 may also generate request data to zoom the specified area. In this case, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to change the display magnification of the specified area to a predetermined display magnification (e.g., 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0-fold magnification). The request data generation module 153 may also generate request data to rotate the specified area. In this case, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to rotate the screen predetermined degrees (e.g., 45, 90, 180 degrees) at one point in the specified area or another area. The request data generation module 153 may generate request data to rotate the screen by another method. Furthermore, if the shared screen displayed in the shared area 300 is a moving image, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to request a change of the moving image to a still image. Furthermore, if the shared screen displayed in the shared area 300 is a still image, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to request a change of the still image to a moving image. The request data transmitting module 142 of the operator terminal 100 transmits the above-mentioned request data to the destination terminal 200 (step S16). The request data receiving module 242 of the destination terminal 200 receives the request data transmitted from the operator terminal 100. The response data generation module 250 of the destination terminal 200 generates response data responding to the received request data (step S17). In the step S17, the response data generation module 250 generates response data in which the resolution of screen data in the area specified by the operator terminal 100 is changed to a higher resolution. In other words, the response data generation module 250 generates response data as data different from the shared screen data transmitted from the destination terminal 200 itself. If the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to change the resolution of shared screen data to a lower resolution, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which the resolution of shared screen data is changed to a lower resolution. Furthermore, if the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to request a change of FPS, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which FPS is changed. Furthermore, if the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to zoom the specified area, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which the display magnification of the specified area is changed to a predetermined display magnification (e.g., 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0-fold magnification). Furthermore, if the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to rotate the specified area, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which the screen is rotated predetermined degrees (e.g., 45, 90, 180 degrees) at one point in the specified area or another area. The response data generation module 250 may also generate response data in which the screen is rotated by another method. Furthermore, if the shared data is a moving image, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which the moving image is changed to a still image. In this case, the response data generation module 250 may generate a still image taken from a moving image at intervals of a predetermined time. The response data generation module 250 may generate a still image by another method. Furthermore, if the shared data is a still image, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which the still image is changed to a moving image. In this case, the response data generation module 250 may connect still images at intervals of a predetermined time to generate a moving image. The response data generation module 250 may generate a moving image by another method. The response data transmitting module 243 of the destination terminal 200 transmits the above-mentioned response data to the operator terminal 100 (step S18). In the step S18, the response data transmitting module 243 transmits response data to the operator terminal 100 by a communication channel different from that transmitting the above-mentioned screen data. Specifically, the shared screen data transmitted from the screen data transfer module 241 of the destination terminal 200 is handled as packet data different from the response data transmitted from the response data transmitting module 243 of the destination terminal 200. As a result, the destination terminal 200 transmits two kinds of packet data to the operator terminal 100. The screen data receiving module 143 of the operator terminal 100 receives the response data transmitted from the destination terminal 200. The response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 changes the specified area based on the received response data and displays the changed specified area as a response screen (step S19). In the step S19, the response data display module 154 superimposed-displays a response screen 320 in a shared area 300 as shown in FIG. 9. Alternatively, the response data display module 154 displays a response screen 320 outside of a shared area 300 as shown in FIG. 10. FIG. 9 shows an example of the response screen displayed by the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100. The response data display module 154 superimposed-displays a response screen 320 in a shared area 300. At this time, the position of a response screen 320 displayed by the response data display module 154 is superimposed-displayed in an area specified by a specifying line 310. The position of a response screen 320 displayed by the response data display module 154 may be another position in a shared area 300. Furthermore, the response data display module 154 may not display a whole response screen 320 but a part of it. The operator terminal 100 may change the display range of a response screen in accordance with a displayable screen resolution as needed. FIG. 10 shows an example of the response screen displayed by the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100. The response data display module 154 displays a response screen 320 outside a shared area 300. The position of a response screen 320 displayed by the response data display module 154 may be another position outside a shared area 300. Furthermore, the response data display module 154 may not display a whole response screen 320 but a part of it. The operator terminal 100 may change the display range of a response screen in accordance with a displayable screen resolution as needed. If the resolution of screen data is changed to a lower resolution in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which the resolution of screen data is changed to a lower resolution, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If FPS is changed in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which FPS is changed, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If display magnification is changed in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which display magnification is changed, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If screen data is rotated in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which screen data is rotated, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If a moving image is changed to a still image in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which a moving image is changed to a still image, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If a still image is changed to a moving image in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which a still image is changed to a moving image, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. Screen Sharing Process in Second Embodiment FIG. 5 is a flow chart of the screen sharing process executed by the operator terminal 100 and the destination terminal 200 in the second embodiment. The tasks executed by the modules of the above-mentioned devices are explained below together with this process. As described above, the operator terminal 100 and the destination terminal 200 may not have functions different from each other and may have the same functions as each other. The operator terminal 100 may have functions of the destination terminal 200 and vice versa. First, the application module 150 of the operator terminal 100 starts an application involved in screen sharing (step S20). The connection request transmitting module 140 of the operator terminal 100 transmits a connection request to the destination terminal 200 to establish network connection necessary for screen sharing (step S21). The connection request receiving module 240 of the destination terminal 200 receives the connection request transmitted from the operator terminal 100. The screen data transfer module 241 of the destination terminal 200 starts network connection with the operator terminal 100 based on the connection request and transmits a screen content displayed on the destination terminal 200 itself to the operator terminal 100 as shared screen data (step S22). The screen data transfer module 141 of the operator terminal 100 receives the shared screen data transmitted from the destination terminal 200. The shared screen display module 151 of the operator terminal 100 displays the received shared screen data in a shared area 300 shown in FIG. 7 (step S23). Then, the input receiving module 152 of the operator terminal 100 judges whether or not the input receiving module 152 receives an operation in the shared area 300. In the step S24, the input receiving module 152 judges whether or not the input receiving module 152 receives an input of operation to change the resolution or to change the display magnification to higher or lower; or rotation or scrolling operation. In the step S24, the input receiving module 152 may receive other operations. In the step S24, if judging that the input receiving module 152 does not receive an operation (NO), the input receiving module 152 repeats this step until receiving an input. On the other hand, if the input receiving module 152 judges that the input receiving module 152 receives an operation (YES) in the step S24, the request data generation module 153 of the operator terminal 100 generates request data to request a change of the area corresponding to the received operation (step S25). In this embodiment, the request data generation module 153 generates request data to change the resolution of shared screen data of the area corresponding to the received operation to a higher resolution in the step S25. The request data generation module 153 may generate request data to change the resolution of the area corresponding to the received operation to a lower resolution. The request data generation module 153 may also generate request data to request a change of FPS of the area corresponding to the received operation. The request data generation module 153 may also generate request data to zoom the area corresponding to the received operation. In this case, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to change the display magnification of the area corresponding to the received operation to a predetermined display magnification (e.g., 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0-fold magnification). The request data generation module 153 may also generate request data to rotate the area corresponding to the received operation. In this case, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to rotate the screen predetermined degrees (e.g., 45, 90, 180 degrees) at one point in the area corresponding to the received operation or another area. Alternatively, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to rotate the screen by another method. The request data generation module 153 may also generate request data to scroll the area corresponding to the received operation. In this case, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to scroll only the area corresponding to the received operation to a prescribed display position (e.g. further one page, three pages, one line, three lines). Furthermore, if the shared screen displayed in the shared area 300 is a moving image, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to request a change of the moving image to a still image. Furthermore, if the shared screen displayed in the shared area 300 is a still image, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to request a change of the still image to a moving image. The request data transmitting module 142 of the operator terminal 100 transmits the above-mentioned request data to the destination terminal 200 (step S26). The request data receiving module 242 of the destination terminal 200 receives the request data transmitted from the operator terminal 100. The response data generation module 250 of the destination terminal 200 generates response data responding to the received request data (step S27). In the step S27, the response data generation module 250 generates response data in which the resolution of screen data in the area corresponding to the operation received by the operator terminal 100 is changed to a higher resolution. In other words, the response data generation module 250 generates response data as data different from the shared screen data transmitted from the destination terminal 200 itself. If the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to change the resolution of shared screen data to a lower resolution, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which the resolution of shared screen data is changed to a lower resolution. Furthermore, if the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to request a change of FPS, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which FPS is changed. Furthermore, if the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to zoom the area corresponding to the received operation, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which the display magnification of the area corresponding to the received operation is changed to a predetermined display magnification (e.g., 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0-fold magnification). Furthermore, if the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to rotate the area corresponding to the received operation, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which the screen is rotated predetermined degrees (e.g., 45, 90, 180 degrees) at one point in the area corresponding to the received operation or another area. The response data generation module 250 may also generate response data in which the screen is rotated by another method. If the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to scroll the area corresponding to the received operation, the response data generation module 250 may also generate response data in which the area corresponding to the received operation is scrolled. In this case, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which only the area corresponding to the received operation is scrolled to a prescribed display position (e.g. further one page, three pages, one line, three lines). Furthermore, if the shared data is a moving image, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which the moving image is changed to a still image. In this case, the response data generation module 250 may generate a still image taken from a moving image at intervals of a predetermined time. The response data generation module 250 may generate a still image by another method. Furthermore, if the shared data is a still image, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which the still image is changed to a moving image. In this case, the response data generation module 250 may connect still images at intervals of a predetermined time to generate a moving image. The response data generation module 250 may generate a moving image by another method. The response data transmitting module 243 of the destination terminal 200 transmits the above-mentioned response data to the operator terminal 100 (step S28). In the step S28, the response data transmitting module 243 transmits response data to the operator terminal 100 by a communication channel different from that transmitting the above-mentioned screen data. Specifically, the shared screen data transmitted from the screen data transfer module 241 of the destination terminal 200 is handled as packet data different from the response data transmitted from the response data transmitting module 243 of the destination terminal 200. As a result, the destination terminal 200 transmits two kinds of packet data to the operator terminal 100. The screen data receiving module 143 of the operator terminal 100 receives the response data transmitted from the destination terminal 200. The response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 changes the specified area based on the received response data and displays the changed specified area as a response screen (step S29). In the step S29, the response data display module 154 superimposed-displays a response screen 320 in a shared area 300 as shown in FIG. 9 in the same way as the first embodiment. Alternatively, the response data display module 154 displays a response screen 320 outside a shared area 300 as shown in FIG. 10 in the same way as the first embodiment. If the resolution of screen data is changed to a lower resolution in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which the resolution of screen data is changed to a lower resolution, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If FPS is changed in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which FPS is changed, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If display magnification is changed in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which display magnification is changed, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If screen data is rotated in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which screen data is rotated, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If screen data is scrolled in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which screen data is scrolled, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If a moving image is changed to a still image in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which a moving image is changed to a still image, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If a still image is changed to a moving image in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which a still image is changed to a moving image, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. Screen Sharing Process in Third Embodiment FIG. 6 is a flow chart of the screen sharing process executed by the operator terminal 100 and the destination terminal 200 in the third embodiment. The tasks executed by the modules of the above-mentioned devices are explained below together with this process. As described above, the operator terminal 100 and the destination terminal 200 may not have functions different from each other and may have the same functions as each other. The operator terminal 100 may have functions of the destination terminal 200 and vice versa. First, the application module 150 of the operator terminal 100 starts an application involved in screen sharing (step S30). The connection request transmitting module 140 of the operator terminal 100 transmits a connection request to the destination terminal 200 to establish network connection necessary for screen sharing (step S31). The connection request receiving module 240 of the destination terminal 200 receives the connection request transmitted from the operator terminal 100. The screen data transfer module 241 of the destination terminal 200 starts network connection with the operator terminal 100 based on the connection request and transmits a screen content displayed on the destination terminal 200 itself to the operator terminal 100 as shared screen data (step S32). The screen data transfer module 141 of the operator terminal 100 receives the shared screen data transmitted from the destination terminal 200. The shared screen display module 151 of the operator terminal 100 displays the received shared screen data in a shared area 300 shown in FIG. 7 (step S33). This embodiment will be explained below assuming that the shared screen data is a moving image. Then, the dynamic area detection module 155 of the operator terminal 100 judges whether or not there is an area moving in the shared area 300 (S34). In step S34, the dynamic area detection module 155 judges whether or not there is an area with a different FPS in the shared area 300. Specifically, in the step S34, if a moving image is displayed in the shared area 300, the dynamic area detection module 155 judges whether or not there is an area moving quickly. In the step S34, if judging that there is no moving area (NO), the dynamic area detection module 155 repeats this step. On the other hand, if the dynamic area detection module 155 of the operator terminal 100 judges that there is an moving area (YES) in the step S34, the request data generation module 153 of the operator terminal 100 generates request data to request a change of the detected area (step S35). In this embodiment, the request data generation module 153 generates request data to increase FPS of the detected area in the step S35. The request data generation module 153 may generate request data to change the resolution of the detected area. In this case, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to change the resolution of the detected area to a higher or a lower resolution. The request data generation module 153 may also generate request data to decrease FPS of the detected area. The request data generation module 153 may also generate request data to zoom the detected area. In this case, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to change the display magnification of the detected area to a predetermined display magnification (e.g., 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0-fold magnification). The request data generation module 153 may also generate request data to rotate the detected area. In this case, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to rotate the screen predetermined degrees (e.g., 45, 90, 180 degrees) at one point in the detected area or another area. Alternatively, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to rotate the screen by another method. The request data generation module 153 may also generate request data to scroll the detected area. In this case, the request data generation module 153 may generate request data to scroll only the area corresponding to the received operation to a prescribed display position (e.g. further one page, three pages, one line, three lines). Furthermore, if the shared screen displayed in the shared area 300 is a still image, the request data generation module 153 may also generate request data to request a change of a moving image to a still image. The request data transmitting module 142 of the operator terminal 100 transmits the above-mentioned request data to the destination terminal 200 (step S36). The request data receiving module 242 of the destination terminal 200 receives the request data transmitted from the operator terminal 100. The response data generation module 250 of the destination terminal 200 generates response data responding to the received request data (step S37). In the step S37, the response data generation module 250 generates response data in which FPS of screen data in the area detected by the operator terminal 100 is increased. In other words, the response data generation module 250 generates response data as data different from the shared screen data transmitted from the destination terminal 200 itself. If the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to change the resolution of shared screen data to a higher resolution, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which the resolution of shared screen data is changed to a higher resolution. If the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to change the resolution of shared screen data to a lower resolution, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which the resolution of shared screen data is changed to a lower resolution. Furthermore, if the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to decrease FPS, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which FPS is decreased. Furthermore, if the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to zoom the detected area, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which the display magnification of the area corresponding to the received operation is changed to a predetermined display magnification (e.g., 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0-fold magnification). In this case, the response data generation module 250 may generate not a moving image but high-resolution still image data that is automatically taken as response data. Furthermore, if the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to rotate the detected area, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which the screen is rotated predetermined degrees (e.g., 45, 90, 180 degrees) at one point in the detected area or another area. The response data generation module 250 may also generate response data in which the screen is rotated by another method. Furthermore, if the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to scroll the detected area, the response data generation module 250 may also generate response data in which the detected area is scrolled. In this case, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which only the area corresponding to the received operation is scrolled to a prescribed display position (e.g. further one page, three pages, one line, three lines). Furthermore, if the request data receiving module 242 receives request data to change the detected area from a moving image to a still image, the response data generation module 250 may generate response data in which a moving image is changed to a still image. In this case, the response data generation module 250 may generate a still image taken from a moving image at intervals of a predetermined time. The response data generation module 250 may generate a still image by another method. The response data transmitting module 243 of the destination terminal 200 transmits the above-mentioned response data to the operator terminal 100 (step S38). In the step S38, the response data transmitting module 243 transmits response data to the operator terminal 100 by a communication channel different from that transmitting the above-mentioned screen data. Specifically, the shared screen data transmitted from the screen data transfer module 241 of the destination terminal 200 is handled as packet data different from the response data transmitted from the response data transmitting module 243 of the destination terminal 200. As a result, the destination terminal 200 transmits two kinds of packet data to the operator terminal 100. The screen data receiving module 143 of the operator terminal 100 receives the response data transmitted from the destination terminal 200. The response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 changes the specified area based on the received response data and displays the changed specified area as a response screen (step S39). In the step S39, the response data display module 154 superimposed-displays a response screen 320 in a shared area 300 as shown in FIG. 9 in the same way as the first and the second embodiments. Alternatively, the response data display module 154 displays a response screen 320 outside a shared area 300 as shown in FIG. 10 in the same way as the first and the second embodiments. According to the above-mentioned system configuration, in the third embodiment, if displaying a moving image with a different FPS, for example, if there is a part where a moving image that is moving quickly, the operator terminal 100 can increase FPS of the part that is moving quickly. If the resolution of screen data is changed to a higher resolution in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which the resolution of screen data is changed to a higher resolution, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If the resolution is changed to a lower resolution in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which the resolution of screen data is changed to a lower resolution, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If FPS is decreased in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which FPS is decreased, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If display magnification is changed in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which display magnification is changed, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If screen data is rotated in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which screen data is rotated, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If screen data is scrolled in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which screen data is scrolled, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. If a moving image is changed to a still image in the received response data, the response data display module 154 of the operator terminal 100 may superimposed-display response data in which a moving image is changed to a still image, inside or outside a shared area 300 as a response screen 320. To achieve the means and the functions that are described above, a computer (including CPU, an information processor, and various terminals) reads and executes a predetermined program. For example, a program is provided in forms recorded in a computer-readable record medium such as a flexible disk, a CD (e.g., CD-ROM), or a DVD (e.g., DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM). In this case, a computer reads a program from the record medium, forwards and stores the program to and in an internal or an external storage, and executes it. The program may be previously recorded in, for example, a storage (record medium) such as a magnetic disk, an optical disk, or a magnetic optical disk and provided from the storage to a computer through a communication line.
