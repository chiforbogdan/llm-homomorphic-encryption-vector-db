No. 13/672,538, filed on Nov. 8, 2012, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/557,043, filed Nov. 8, 2011, and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/610,257, filed Mar. 13, 2012, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to modulators of ATP-Binding Cassette (\u201cABC\u201d) transporters or fragments thereof, including Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (\u201cCFTR\u201d), compositions thereof and methods therewith. The present invention also relates to methods of treating ABC transporter mediated diseases using such modulators. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION ABC transporters are a family of membrane transporter proteins that regulate the transport of a wide variety of pharmacological agents, potentially toxic drugs, and xenobiotics, as well as anions. ABC transporters are homologous membrane proteins that bind and use cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for their specific activities. Some of these transporters were discovered as multidrug resistance proteins (like the MDR1-P glycoprotein, or the multidrug resistance protein, MRP1), defending malignant cancer cells against chemotherapeutic agents. To date, 48 ABC Transporters have been identified and grouped into 7 families based on their sequence identity and function. ABC transporters regulate a variety of important physiological roles within the body and provide defense against harmful environmental compounds. Because of this, they represent important potential drug targets for the treatment of diseases associated with defects in the transporter, prevention of drug transport out of the target cell, and intervention in other diseases in which modulation of ABC transporter activity may be beneficial. One member of the ABC transporter family commonly associated with disease is the cAMP I ATP-mediated anion channel, CFTR. CFTR is expressed in a variety of cells types, including absorptive and secretory epithelia cells, where it regulates anion flux across the membrane, as well as the activity of other ion channels and proteins. In epithelia cells, normal functioning of CFTR is critical for the maintenance of electrolyte transport throughout the body, including respiratory and digestive tissue. CFTR is composed of approximately 1480 amino acids that encode a protein made up of a tandem repeat of transmembrane domains, each containing six transmembrane helices and a nucleotide binding domain. The two transmembrane domains are linked by a large, polar, regulatory (R)-domain with multiple phosphorylation sites that regulate channel activity and cellular trafficking. The gene encoding CFTR has been identified and sequenced (See Gregory, R. J. et al. (1990) Nature 347:382-386; Rich, D. P. et al. (1990) Nature 347:358-362), (Riordan, J. R. et al. (1989) Science 245:1066-1073). A defect in this gene causes mutations in CFTR resulting in Cystic Fibrosis (\u201cCF\u201d), the most common fatal genetic disease in humans. Cystic Fibrosis affects approximately one in every 2,500 infants in the United States. Within the general United States population, up to 10 million people carry a single copy of the defective gene without apparent ill effects. In contrast, individuals with two copies of the CF associated gene suffer from the debilitating and fatal effects of CF, including chronic lung disease. In patients with cystic fibrosis, mutations in CFTR endogenously expressed in respiratory epithelia leads to reduced apical anion secretion causing an imbalance in ion and fluid transport. The resulting decrease in anion transport contributes to enhanced mucus accumulation in the lung and the accompanying microbial infections that ultimately cause death in CF patients. In addition to respiratory disease, CF patients typically suffer from gastrointestinal problems and pancreatic insufficiency that, if left untreated, results in death. In addition, the majority of males with cystic fibrosis are infertile and fertility is decreased among females with cystic fibrosis. In contrast to the severe effects of two copies of the CF associated gene, individuals with a single copy of the CF associated gene exhibit increased resistance to cholera and to dehydration resulting from diarrhea\u2014perhaps explaining the relatively high frequency of the CF gene within the population. Sequence analysis of the CFTR gene of CF chromosomes has revealed a variety of disease causing mutations (Cutting, G. R. et al. (1990) Nature 346:366-369; Dean, M. et al. (1990) Cell 61:863:870; and Kerem, B-S. et al. (1989) Science 245:1073-1080; Kerem, B-S et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:8447-8451). To date, >1000 disease causing mutations in the CF gene have been identified (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/). The most prevalent mutation is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 of the CFTR amino acid sequence, and is commonly referred to as \u0394F508-CFTR. This mutation occurs in approximately 70% of the cases of cystic fibrosis and is associated with a severe disease. The deletion of residue 508 in \u0394F508-CFTR prevents the nascent protein from folding correctly. This results in the inability of the mutant protein to exit the ER, and traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, the number of channels present in the membrane is far less than observed in cells expressing wild-type CFTR. In addition to impaired trafficking, the mutation results in defective channel gating. Together, the reduced number of channels in the membrane and the defective gating lead to reduced anion transport across epithelia leading to defective ion and fluid transport. (Quinton, P. M. (1990), F ASEB J. 4: 2709-2727). Studies have shown, however, that the reduced numbers of \u0394F508-CFTR in the membrane are functional, albeit less than wild-type CFTR. (Dalemans et al. (1991), Nature Lond. 354: 526-528; Denning et al., supra; Pasyk and Foskett (1995), J. Cell. Biochem. 270: 12347-50). In addition to \u0394F508-CFTR, other disease causing mutations in CFTR that result in defective trafficking, synthesis, and/or channel gating could be up- or down-regulated to alter anion secretion and modify disease progression and/or severity. Although CFTR transports a variety of molecules in addition to anions, it is clear that this role (the transport of anions) represents one element in an important mechanism of transporting ions and water across the epithelium. The other elements include the epithelial Na+ channel, ENaC, Na+/2Cl\u2212/K+ co-transporter, Na+\u2014K+-ATPase pump and the basolateral membrane K+ channels, that are responsible for the uptake of chloride into the cell. These elements work together to achieve directional transport across the epithelium via their selective expression and localization within the cell. Chloride absorption takes place by the coordinated activity of ENaC and CFTR present on the apical membrane and the Na+\u2014K+-ATPase pump and Cl\u2212 channels expressed on the basolateral surface of the cell. Secondary active transport of chloride from the luminal side leads to the accumulation of intracellular chloride, which can then passively leave the cell via Cl\u2212 channels, resulting in a vectorial transport. Arrangement of Na+/2Cl\u2212/K+ co-transporter. Na+\u2014K+-ATPase pump and the basolateral membrane K+ channels on the basolateral surface and CFTR on the luminal side coordinate the secretion of chloride via CFTR on the luminal side. Because water is probably never actively transported itself, its flow across epithelia depends on tiny transepithelial osmotic gradients generated by the bulk flow of sodium and chloride. In addition to Cystic Fibrosis, modulation of CFTR activity may be beneficial for other diseases not directly caused by mutations in CFTR, such as secretory diseases and other protein folding diseases mediated by CFTR. These include, but are not limited to, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dry eye disease, and Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome. COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is progressive and not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is due to mucus hypersecretion, emphysema, and bronchiolitis. Activators of mutant or wild-type CFTR offer a potential treatment of mucus hypersecretion and impaired mucociliary clearance that is common in COPD. Specifically, increasing anion secretion across CFTR may facilitate fluid transport into the airway surface liquid to hydrate the mucus and optimized periciliary fluid viscosity. This would lead to enhanced mucociliary clearance and a reduction in the symptoms associated with COPD. Dry eye disease is characterized by a decrease in tear aqueous production and abnormal tear film lipid, protein and mucin profiles. There are many causes of dry eye, some of which include age, Lasik eye surgery, arthritis, medications, chemical/thermal burns, allergies, and diseases, such as Cystic Fibrosis and Sj\u00f6grens's syndrome. Increasing anion secretion via CFTR would enhance fluid transport from the corneal endothelial cells and secretory glands surrounding the eye to increase corneal hydration. This would help to alleviate the symptoms associated with dry eye disease. Sj\u00f6grens's syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks moisture-producing glands throughout the body, including the eye, mouth, skin, respiratory tissue, liver, vagina, and gut. Symptoms, include, dry eye, mouth, and vagina, as well as lung disease. The disease is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, systemic sclerosis, and polymypositis/dermatomyositis. Defective protein trafficking is believed to cause the disease, for which treatment options are limited. Modulators of CFTR activity may hydrate the various organs afflicted by the disease and help to elevate the associated symptoms. As discussed above, it is believed that the deletion of residue 508 in \u0394F508-CFTR prevents the nascent protein from folding correctly, resulting in the inability of this mutant protein to exit the ER, and traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, insufficient amounts of the mature protein are present at the plasma membrane and chloride transport within epithelial tissues is significantly reduced. In fact, this cellular phenomenon of defective ER processing of ABC transporters by the ER machinery has been shown to be the underlying basis not only for CF disease, but for a wide range of other isolated and inherited diseases. The two ways that the ER machinery can malfunction is either by loss of coupling to ER export of the proteins leading to degradation, or by the ER accumulation of these defective/misfolded proteins [Aridor M, et al., Nature Med., 5(7), pp 745-751 (1999); Shastry, B. S., et al., Neurochem. International, 43, pp 1-7 (2003); Rutishauser, J., et al., Swiss Med Wkly, 132, pp 211-222 (2002); Morello, J P et al., TIPS, 21, pp. 466-469 (2000); Bross P., et al., Human Mut., 14, pp. 186-198 (1999)]. The diseases associated with the first class of ER malfunction are Cystic fibrosis (due to misfolded \u0394F508-CFTR as discussed above), emphysema (due to a1-antitrypsin; non Piz variants), Hereditary hemochromatosis, Coagulation-Fibrinolysis deficiencies, such as Protein C deficiency, Type 1 hereditary angioedema, Lipid processing deficiencies, such as Familial hypercholesterolemia, Type 1 chylomicronemia, Abetalipoproteinemia, Lysosomal storage diseases, such as I-cell disease/Pseudo-Hurler, Mucopolysaccharidoses (due to Lysosomal processing enzymes), Sandhof/Tay-Sachs (due to 13-Hexosaminidase), Crigler-Najjar type II (due to UDP-glucuronyl-sialyc-transferase), Polyendocrinopathy/Hyperinsulemia, Diabetes mellitus (due to Insulin receptor). Laron dwarfism (due to Growth hormone receptor), Myleoperoxidase deficiency, Primary hypoparathyroidism (due to Preproparathyroid hormone), Melanoma (due to Tyrosinase). The diseases associated with the latter class of ER malfunction are Glycanosis CDG type 1, emphysema (due to \u03b11-Antitrypsin (PiZ variant), Congenital hyperthyroidism, Osteogenesis imperfecta (due to Type I, II, IV procollagen), Hereditary hypofibrinogenemia (due to Fibrinogen), ACT deficiency (due to \u03b11-Antichymotrypsin), Diabetes insipidus (DI), Neurophyseal DI (due to Vasopvessin hormoneN2-receptor), Neprogenic DI (due to Aquaporin II), Charcot-Marie Tooth syndrome (due to Peripheral myelin protein 22), Perlizaeus-Merzbacher disease, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (due to \u03b2APP and presenilins), Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Progressive supranuclear plasy. Pick's disease, several polyglutamine neurological disorders asuch as Huntington, Spinocerebullar ataxia type I, Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, Dentatorubal pallidoluysian, and Myotonic dystrophy, as well as Spongiform encephalopathies, such as Hereditary Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (due to Prion protein processing defect), Fabry disease (due to lysosomal \u03b1-galactosidase A) and Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (due to Prp processing defect). In addition to up-regulation of CFTR activity, reducing anion secretion by CFTR modulators may be beneficial for the treatment of secretory diarrheas, in which epithelial water transport is dramatically increased as a result of secretagogue activated chloride transport. The mechanism involves elevation of cAMP and stimulation of CFTR. Although there are numerous causes of diarrhea, the major consequences of diarrheal diseases, resulting from excessive chloride transport are common to all, and include dehydration, acidosis, impaired growth and death. Acute and chronic diarrheas represent a major medical problem in many areas of the world. Diarrhea is both a significant factor in malnutrition and the leading cause of death (5,000,000 deaths/year) in children less than five years old. Secretory diarrheas are also a dangerous condition in patients of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 16 million travelers to developing countries from industrialized nations every year develop diarrhea, with the severity and number of cases of diarrhea varying depending on the country and area of travel. Diarrhea in barn animals and pets such as cows, pigs and horses, sheep, goats, cats and dogs, also known as scours, is a major cause of death in these animals. Diarrhea can result from any major transition, such as weaning or physical movement, as well as in response to a variety of bacterial or viral infections and generally occurs within the first few hours of the animal's life. The most common diarrhea causing bacteria is enterotoxogenic E-coli (ETEC) having the K99 pilus antigen. Common viral causes of diarrhea include rotavirus and coronavirus. Other infectious agents include cryptosporidium, giardia lamblia, and salmonella, among others. Symptoms of rotaviral infection include excretion of watery feces, dehydration and weakness. Coronavirus causes a more severe illness in the newborn animals, and has a higher mortality rate than rotaviral infection. Often, however, a young animal may be infected with more than one virus or with a combination of viral and bacterial microorganisms at one time. This dramatically increases the severity of the disease. Accordingly, there is a need for modulators of an ABC transporter activity, and compositions thereof, that can be used to modulate the activity of the ABC transporter in the cell membrane of a mammal. There is a need for methods of treating ABC transporter mediated diseases using such modulators of ABC transporter activity. There is a need for methods of modulating an ABC transporter activity in an ex vivo cell membrane of a mammal. There is a need for modulators of CFTR activity that can be used to modulate the activity of CFTR in the cell membrane of a mammal. There is a need for methods of treating CFTR-mediated diseases using such modulators of CFTR activity. There is a need for methods of modulating CFTR activity in an ex vivo cell membrane of a mammal.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions As used herein, the following definitions shall apply unless otherwise indicated. The term \u201cABC-transporter\u201d as used herein means an ABC-transporter protein or a fragment thereof comprising at least one binding domain, wherein said protein or fragment thereof is present in vivo or in vitro. The term \u201cbinding domain\u201d as used herein means a domain on the ABC-transporter that can bind to a modulator. See, e.g., Hwang, T. C. et al., J. Gen. Physiol. (1998): 111(3), 477-90. The term \u201cCFTR\u201d as used herein means cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or a mutation thereof capable of regulator activity, including, but not limited to, \u0394F508 CFTR and G551D CFTR (see, e.g., http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/, for CFTR mutations). The term \u201cmodulating\u201d as used herein means increasing or decreasing, e.g. activity, by a measurable amount. Compounds that modulate ABC Transporter activity, such as CFTR activity, by increasing the activity of the ABC Transporter. e.g., a CFTR anion channel, are called agonists. Compounds that modulate ABC Transporter activity, such as CFTR activity, by decreasing the activity of the ABC Transporter, e.g., CFTR anion channel, are called antagonists. An agonist interacts with an ABC Transporter, such as CFTR anion channel, to increase the ability of the receptor to transduce an intracellular signal in response to endogenous ligand binding. An antagonist interacts with an ABC Transporter, such as CFTR, and competes with the endogenous ligand(s) or substrate(s) for binding site(s) on the receptor to decrease the ability of the receptor to transduce an intracellular signal in response to endogenous ligand binding. The phrase \u201ctreating or reducing the severity of an ABC Transporter mediated disease\u201d refers both to treatments for diseases that are directly caused by ABC Transporter and/or CFTR activities and alleviation of symptoms of diseases not directly caused by ABC Transporter and/or CFTR anion channel activities.

Overview of the Synthesis of Compounds of Formula I and Formula II Compounds of formula I can be prepared by coupling an acid chloride moiety with an amine moiety followed by ring closure according to following Schemes 1 to 5. Scheme 1 depicts the preparation of R and R1 substituted benzo-cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride, which is used in Scheme 3 to make the amide linkage of compounds of formula I. Scheme 2 provides an alternative synthesis of the requisite acid chloride. R substituted 5-bromobenzene is coupled with ethyl cyanoacetate in the presence of a palladium catalyst to form the corresponding alpha cyano ethyl ester. Saponification of the ester moiety to the carboxylic acid gives the cyanoethyl compound. Alkylation of the cyanoethyl compound with R1 substituted 1-bromo-2-chloro ethane in the presence of base gives the cyanocyclopropyl compound. Treatment of the cyanocyclopropyl compound with base gives the carboxylate salt, which is converted to the carboxylic acid by treatment with acid. Conversion of the carboxylic acid to the acid chloride is then accomplished using a chlorinating agent such as thionyl chloride or the like. Scheme 3 provides an overview of the synthesis of the amine moiety of compounds of formula I via a Sonagashira/cyclization protocol. From the silyl protected propargyl alcohol shown, conversion to the propargyl chloride followed by formation of the Grignard reagent and subsequent nucleophilic substitution provides ((R3-substituted-but-3-ynyloxy)methyl)benzene, which is used in another step of the synthesis. To complete the amine moiety, 4-nitro-3-R2-aniline is first brominated, and then converted to the toluenesulfonic acid salt of (R)-1-(4-amino-2-bromo-5-R2-substituted-phenylamino)-3-(benzyloxy)propan-2-ol in a two-step process beginning with alkylation of the aniline amino group by (R)-2-(benzyloxymethyl)oxirane, followed by reduction of the nitro group to the corresponding amine. Palladium catalyzed coupling of the product with ((R3-substituted-but-3-ynyloxy)methyl)benzene (discussed above) provides the intermediate alkynyl compound which is then cyclized to the indole moiety to produce the benzyl protected amine moiety. Scheme 4 depicts the coupling of the Acid and Amine moieties. In the first step, (R)-1-(5-amino-2-(1-(benzyloxy)-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-6-R21H-indol-1-yl)-3-(benzyloxy)propan-2-ol is coupled with 1-(R-substituted-5-yl)cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride to provide the benzyl protected precursors to compounds of formula I. This step can be performed in the presence of a base and a solvent. The base can be an organic base such as triethylamine, and the solvent can be an organic solvent such as DCM or a mixture of DCM and toluene. In the last step, the benzylated intermediate is deprotected to produce precursors to compounds of formula I. The deprotection step can be accomplished using reducing conditions sufficient to remove the benzyl group. The reducing conditions can be hydrogenation conditions such as hydrogen gas in the presence of a palladium catalyst to provide the alcohol. This material can be converted directly to a compound of formula I via microbial oxidation. Scheme 5 provides the preparation of a compound of formula II. The product depicted in Scheme 4 is oxidized with pyridinium dichromate in dichloromethane to provide the compound of formula II. Scheme 6 provides the preparation of a compound of formula I from a compound of formula II. Oxidation of the compound of formula II depicted in Scheme 5 with silver carbonate in the presence of Celite initially gives a cyclic lactone product, which is hydrolyzed in the presence of 2N sodium hydroxide to provide the compound of formula I. Scheme 7 provides an alternative process for preparing a compound of formula I. The product of Scheme 5 is treated with carbonyl di-imidazole in dichloromethane followed by an acid work-up to provide the carbonate ester. Subsequent steps involve oxidation of the primary alcohol to the aldehyde and subsequently to the carboxylic acid followed by deprotection to give a compound of formula I. Oxidation conditions to convert the alcohol to the aldehyde include Parikh-Doering oxidation of the primary alcohol moiety using sulfur trioxide pyridine complex to give the corresponding aldehyde. Alternative oxidation agents to convert the primary alcohol to the aldehyde include pyridinium dichromate (PDC), N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS)/benzenesulfenamide (PhSNHtBu) optionally in the presence of 2-methyl-2-butene as a chlorine scavenger, RuCl3/NaIO4, tetramethylpiperidine N-oxide (TEMPO)/bisacetoxyiodobenzene (BIAB)/NaHCO3, or 2-iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX). Oxidation conditions to convert the aldehyde to the carboxylic include sodium or potassium permanganate. Sodium carbonate-mediated deprotection in methanol provides the compound of formula 1. Alternatively, one-pot synthesis of the carboxylic acid can be accomplished using tetrapropylammonium perruthenate (TPAP)/N-Methyl morpholine N-oxide (NMO) monohydrate as depicted in Scheme 8. Other oxidants that can be used for this transformation include Oxone/TPAP/NMO/TBAB, and KMnO4. The protected carboxylic acid can be deprotected using a base to form a compound of formula I, as depicted in Scheme 9. Bases that can be used for this transformation include NaOH, Na2CO3, NaHCO3, or Na2CO3/NaHCO3. Scheme 10 provides an alternative process for making compounds of formula I via a Sonagashira/cyclization protocol similar to that described in Scheme 3 and 4. From the silyl protected propargyl alcohol shown, conversion to the propargyl chloride followed by formation of the Grignard reagent and subsequent nucleophilic substitution provides ((R3-substituted-isopropyl ester, which is used in another step of the synthesis. To complete the amine moiety, 4-nitro-3-R2-aniline is first brominated, and then converted to the toluenesulfonic acid salt of (R)-1-(4-amino-2-bromo-5-R2-substituted-phenylamino)-3-(benzyloxy)propan-2-ol in a two-step process beginning with alkylation of the aniline amino group by (R)-2-(benzyloxymethyl)oxirane, followed by reduction of the nitro group to the corresponding amine. Palladium catalyzed coupling of the product with the R3-substituted-isopropyl ester (discussed above) provides the intermediate alkynyl compound, which is then cyclized to the indole moiety to produce the benzyl protected amine moiety. The same process can be used from silyl propargyl alcohol to give the benzyl ester. Subsequent coupling with 1-(R-substituted-5-yl)cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride according to Scheme 4 provides the isopropyl ester of a compound of Formula I. The hydrolysis of the isopropyl ester of Scheme 11 provides the compound of formula Ia. Bases that can be used for this transformation include alkali and alkali metal hydroxides; NaOH, or LiOH, for instance can be used. Scheme 12 depicts the synthesis of a compound of formula Ia or IIa where R2 is F. In the first step, the diol is treated with carbonyl di-imidazole to protect the diol moiety as the carbonate ester and then the oxidant N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS)/benzenesulfenamide (PhSNHtBu), used optionally in the presence of 2-methyl-2-butene as a chlorine scavenger, provides the intermediate aldehyde. The intermediate aldehyde is converted to the compound of formula Ia wherein R2 is F via treatment with permanganate, followed by deprotection in the presence of a base such as Na2CO3, to give the desired carboxylic acid as the sodium salt. Alternatively, the intermediate aldehyde is converted to the compound of formula II a, where R2 is F, via treatment with a base such as Na2CO3.

The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular agent, its mode of administration, and the like. The compounds of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression \u201cdosage unit form\u201d as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of agent appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific effective dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder, the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts. The term \u201cpatient\u201d, as used herein, means an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human. The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactidepolyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues. Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hardfilled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The active compounds can also be in microencapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, eardrops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms are prepared by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel. As described generally above, the compounds of the invention are useful as modulators of ABC transporters. Thus, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the compounds and compositions are particularly useful for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where hyperactivity or inactivity of ABC transporters is implicated in the disease, condition, or disorder. When hyperactivity or inactivity of an ABC transporter is implicated in a particular disease, condition, or disorder, the disease, condition, or disorder may also be referred to as a \u201cABC transporter-mediated disease, condition or disorder\u201d. Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where hyperactivity or inactivity of an ABC transporter is implicated in the disease state. The activity of a compound utilized in this invention as a modulator of an ABC transporter may be assayed according to methods described generally in the art and in the Examples herein. It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination therapies, that is, the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can be administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another agent used to treat the same disorder), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects). As used herein, additional therapeutic agents that are normally administered to treat or prevent a particular disease, or condition, are known as \u201cappropriate for the disease, or condition, being treated\u201d.

The compounds of this invention or pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof may also be incorporated into compositions for coating an implantable medical device, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Accordingly, the present invention, in another aspect, includes a composition for coating an implantable device comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. In still another aspect, the present invention includes an implantable device coated with a composition comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coatings are typically biocompatible polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane, polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and mixtures thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of fluorosilicone, polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations thereof to impart controlled release characteristics in the composition. Another aspect of the invention relates to modulating ABC transporter activity in a biological sample or a patient (e.g., in vitro or in vivo), which method comprises administering to the patient, or contacting said biological sample with a compound of formula I or a composition comprising said compound. The term \u201cbiological sample\u201d, as used herein, includes, without limitation, cell cultures or extracts thereof; biopsied material obtained from a mammal or extracts thereof; and blood, saliva, urine, feces, semen, tears, or other body fluids or extracts thereof. Modulation of ABC transporter activity in a biological sample is useful for a variety of purposes that are known to one of skill in the art. Examples of such purposes include, but are not limited to, the study of ABC transporters in biological and pathological phenomena; and the comparative evaluation of new modulators of ABC transporters. In yet another embodiment, a method of modulating activity of an anion channel in vitro or in vivo, is provided comprising the step of contacting said channel with a compound of formulae I or Ia. In preferred embodiments, the anion channel is a chloride channel or a bicarbonate channel. In other preferred embodiments, the anion channel is a chloride channel. According to an alternative embodiment, the present invention provides a method of increasing the number of functional ABC transporters in a membrane of a cell, comprising the step of contacting said cell with a compound of formulae (I or Ia). The term \u201cfunctional ABC transporter\u201d as used herein means an ABC transporter that is capable of transport activity. In preferred embodiments, said functional ABC transporter is CFTR. According to another preferred embodiment, the activity of the ABC transporter is measured by measuring the transmembrane voltage potential. Means for measuring the voltage potential across a membrane in the biological sample may employ any of the known methods in the art, such as optical membrane potential assay or other electrophysiological methods. The optical membrane potential assay utilizes voltage-sensitive FRET sensors described by Gonzalez and Tsien (See, Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1995) \u201cVoltage sensing by fluorescence resonance energy transfer in single cells\u201d Biophys J 69(4): 1272-80, and Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1997) \u201cImproved indicators of cell membrane potential that use fluorescence resonance energy transfer\u201d Chem Biol 4(4): 269-77) in combination with instrumentation for measuring fluorescence changes such as the Voltage/Ion Probe Reader (VIPR) (See. Gonzalez, J. E., K. Oades, et al. (1999) \u201cCell-based assays and instrumentation for screening ion-channel targets\u201d Drug Discov Today 4(9): 431-439). These voltage sensitive assays are based on the change in fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET) between the membrane-soluble, voltage-sensitive dye, DiSBAC2(3), and a fluorescent phospholipid, CC2-DMPE, which is attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and acts as a FRET donor. Changes in membrane potential (Vm) cause the negatively charged DiSBAC2(3) to redistribute across the plasma membrane and the amount of energy transfer from CC2-DMPE changes accordingly. The changes in fluorescence emission can be monitored using VIPR\u2122 II, which is an integrated liquid handler and fluorescent detector designed to conduct cell-based screens in 96- or 384-well microtiter plates. In another aspect the present invention provides a kit for use in measuring the activity of a ABC transporter or a fragment thereof in a biological sample in vitro or in vivo comprising (i) a composition comprising a compound of formulae (I or Ia) or any of the above embodiments; and (ii) instructions for a.) contacting the composition with the biological sample and b.) measuring activity of said ABC transporter or a fragment thereof. In one embodiment, the kit further comprises instructions for a.) contacting an additional composition with the biological sample; b.) measuring the activity of said ABC transporter or a fragment thereof in the presence of said additional compound, and c.) comparing the activity of the ABC transporter in the presence of the additional compound with the density of the ABC transporter in the presence of a composition of formulae (I or Ia). In preferred embodiments, the kit is used to measure the density of CFTR. In order that the invention described herein may be more fully understood, the following examples are set forth. It should be understood that these examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting this invention in any manner.

Anywhere in the present application where a name of a compound may not correctly describe the structure of the compound, the structure supersedes the name and governs. Acid Chloride Moiety Synthesis of (2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-methanol Commercially available 2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxole-5-carboxylic acid (1.0 eq) is slurried in toluene (10 vol).

NaOH (4.0 eq) is carefully added via addition funnel maintaining the temperature at 40-50\u00b0 C. After stirring for an additional 30 minutes, the layers are allowed to separate at 40\u00b0 C. The organic phase is cooled to 20\u00b0 C. then washed with water (2\u00d71.5 vol), dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated to afford crude (2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-methanol that is used directly in the next step. Synthesis of 5-chloromethyl-2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxole (2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-methanol (1.0 eq) is dissolved in MTBE (5 vol). A catalytic amount of DMAP (1 mol %) is added and SOCl2 (1.2 eq) is added via addition funnel. The SOCl2 is added at a rate to maintain the temperature in the reactor at 15-25\u00b0 C. The temperature is increased to 30\u00b0 C. for 1 hour then cooled to 20\u00b0 C. then water (4 vol) is added via addition funnel maintaining the temperature at less than 30\u00b0 C. After stirring for an additional 30 minutes, the layers are allowed to separate. The organic layer is stirred and 10% (w/v) aq. NaOH (4.4 vol) is added.

Synthesis of (2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-acetonitrile A solution of 5-chloromethyl-2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxole (1 eq) in DMSO (1.25 vol) is added to a slurry of NaCN (1.4 eq) in DMSO (3 vol) maintaining the temperature between 30-40\u00b0 C. The mixture is stirred for 1 hour then water (6 vol) is added followed by MTBE (4 vol). After stirring for 30 min, the layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with MTBE (1.8 vol). The combined organic layers are washed with water (1.8 vol), dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated to afford crude (2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-acetonitrile (95%) that is used directly in the next step. Synthesis of (2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-cyclopropanecarbonitrile A stock solution of 50% w/w NaOH was degassed via nitrogen sparge for no less than 16 h. An appropriate amount of MTBE was similarly degassed for several hours. To a reactor purged with nitrogen was charged degassed MTBE (143 mL) followed by (2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-acetonitrile (40.95 g, 207.7 mmol) and tetrabutylanunonium bromide (2.25 g, 10.38 mmol). The volume of the mixture was noted and the mixture was degassed via nitrogen sparge for 30 min. Enough degassed MTBE is charged to return the mixture to the original volume prior to degassing. To the stirring mixture at 23.0\u00b0 C. was charged degassed 50% w/w NaOH (143 mL) over 10 min followed by 1-bromo-2-chloroethane (44.7 g, 311.6 mmol) over 30 min. The reaction was analyzed by HPLC in 1 h intervals for % conversion. Before sampling, stirring was stopped and the phases allowed to separate. The top organic phase was sampled for analysis. When a % conversion >99% was observed (typically after 2.5-3 h), the reaction mixture was cooled to 10\u00b0 C. and was charged with water (461 mL) at such a rate as to maintain a temperature <25\u00b0 C. The temperature was adjusted to 20-25\u00b0 C. and the phases separated. Note: sufficient time should be allowed for complete phase separation. The aqueous phase was extracted with MTBE (123 mL), and the combined organic phase was washed with 1 N HCl (163 mL) and 5% NaCl (163 mL). The solution of (2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarbonitrile in MTBE was concentrated to 164 mL under vacuum at 40-50\u00b0 C. The solution was charged with ethanol (256 mL) and again concentrated to 164 mL under vacuum at 50-60\u00b0 C. Ethanol (256 mL) was charged and the mixture concentrated to 164 mL under vacuum at 50-60\u00b0 C. The resulting mixture was cooled to 20-25\u00b0 C. and diluted with ethanol to 266 mL in preparation for the next step. 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO) \u03b4 7.43 (d, J=8.4 Hz, 1H), 7.40 (d, J=1.9 Hz, 1H), 7.30 (dd, J=8.4, 1.9 Hz, 1H), 1.75 (m, 2H), 1.53 (m, 2H). Synthesis of 1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid The solution of (2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-cyclopropanecarbonitrile in ethanol from the previous step was charged with 6 N NaOH (277 mL) over 20 min and heated to an internal temperature of 77-78\u00b0 C. over 45 min. The reaction progress was monitored by HPLC after 16 h. Note: the consumption of both (2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarbonitrile and the primary amide resulting from partial hydrolysis of (2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-cyclopropanecarbonitrile were monitored. When a % conversion >99% was observed (typically 100% conversion after 16 h), the reaction mixture was cooled to 25\u00b0 C. and charged with ethanol (41 mL) and DCM (164 mL). The solution was cooled to 10\u00b0 C. and charged with 6 N HCl (290 mL) at such a rate as to maintain a temperature <25\u00b0 C. After warming to 20-25\u00b0 C., the phases were allowed to separate. The bottom organic phase was collected and the top aqueous phase was back extracted with DCM (164 mL). Note: the aqueous phase was somewhat cloudy before and after the extraction due to a high concentration of inorganic salts. The organics were combined and concentrated under vacuum to 164 mL. Toluene (328 mL) was charged and the mixture condensed to 164 mL at 70-75\u00b0 C. The mixture was cooled to 45\u00b0 C., charged with MTBE (364 mL) and stirred at 60\u00b0 C. for 20 min. The solution was cooled to 25\u00b0 C. and polish filtered to remove residual inorganic salts. MTBE (123 mL) was used to rinse the reactor and the collected solids. The combined organics were transferred to a clean reactor in preparation for the next step. Isolation of 1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-S-yl)-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid The solution of 1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid from the previous step is concentrated under vacuum to 164 mL, charged with toluene (328 mL) and concentrated to 164 mL at 70-75\u00b0 C.

After stirring at that temperature for 30 min, the solution was cooled to 5\u00b0 C. over 2 hours and maintained at 5\u00b0 C. for 3 hours. The mixture was then filtered and the reactor and collected solid washed with cold 1:1 toluene/n-heptane (2\u00d7123 mL). The material was dried under vacuum at 55\u00b0 C. for 17 hours to provide 1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid as an off-white crystalline solid. 1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid was isolated in 79% yield from (2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-acetonitrile (3 steps including isolation) and with an HPLC purity of 99.0% AUC.

Alternative Synthesis of the Acid Chloride Moiety Synthesis of (2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-1-ethylacetate-acetonitrile A reactor was purged with nitrogen and charged with 900 mL of toluene. The solvent was degassed via nitrogen sparge for no less than 16 h. To the reactor was then charged Na3PO4 (155.7 g, 949.5 mmol), followed by bis(dibenzylideneacetone) palladium (0) (7.28 g, 12.66 mmol). A 10% w/w solution of tert-butylphosphine in hexanes (51.23 g, 25.32 mmol) was charged over 10 min at 23\u00b0 C. from a nitrogen purged addition funnel. The mixture was allowed to stir for 50 min, at which time 5-bromo-2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxole (75 g, 316.5 mmol) was added over 1 min. After stirring for an additional 50 min, the mixture was charged with ethyl cyanoacetate (71.6 g, 633.0 mmol) over 5 min followed by water (4.5 mL) in one portion. The mixture was heated to 70\u00b0 C. over 40 min and analyzed by HPLC every 1-2 h for the percent conversion of the reactant to the product. After conversion was observed (typically 100% conversion after 5-8 h), the mixture was cooled to 20-25\u00b0 C. and filtered through a celite pad. The celite pad was rinsed with toluene (2\u00d7450 mL) and the combined organics were concentrated to 300 mL under vacuum at 60-65\u00b0 C. The concentrate was charged with 225 mL DMSO and concentrated under vacuum at 70-80\u00b0 C. until active distillation of the solvent ceased. The solution was cooled to 20-25\u00b0 C. and diluted to 900 mL with DMSO in preparation for Step 2. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) \u03b4 7.16-7.10 (m, 2H), 7.03 (d, J=8.2 Hz, 1H), 4.63 (s, 1H), 4.19 (m, 2H), 1.23 (t, J=7.1 Hz, 3H).

The mixture was then heated to 75\u00b0 C. over 1 h and analyzed by HPLC every 1-2 h for % conversion. When a conversion of >99% was observed (typically after 5-6 h), the reaction was cooled to 20-25\u00b0 C. and extracted with MTBE (2\u00d7525 mL), with sufficient time to allow for complete phase separation during the extractions. The combined organic extracts were washed with 5% NaCl (2\u00d7375 mL). The solution was then transferred to equipment appropriate for a 1.5-2.5 Torr vacuum distillation that was equipped with a cooled receiver flask. The solution was concentrated under vacuum at <60\u00b0 C. to remove the solvents. (2,2-Difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-acetonitrile was then distilled from the resulting oil at 125-130\u00b0 C.

Amine Moiety Synthesis of 2-bromo-5-fluoro-4-nitroaniline A flask was charged with 3-fluoro-4-nitroaniline (1.0 equiv) followed by ethyl acetate (10 vol) and stirred to dissolve all solids. N-Bromosuccinimide (1.0 equiv) was added as a portion-wise as to maintain internal temperature of 22\u00b0 C. At the end of the reaction, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo on a rotavap. The residue was slurried in distilled water (5 vol) to dissolve and remove succinimide. (The succinimide can also be removed by water workup procedure.) The water was decanted and the solid was slurried in 2-propanol (5 vol) overnight. The resulting slurry was filtered and the wetcake was washed with 2-propanol, dried in vacuum oven at 50\u00b0 C. overnight with N2 bleed until constant weight was achieved.

Synthesis of (3-Chloro-3-methylbut-1-ynyl)trimethylsilane Propargyl alcohol (1.0 equiv) was charged to a vessel. Aqueous hydrochloric acid (37%, 3.75 vol) was added and stirring begun. During dissolution of the solid alcohol, a modest endotherm (5-6\u00b0 C.) is observed. The resulting mixture was stirred overnight (16 h), slowly becoming dark red. A 30 L jacketed vessel is charged with water (5 vol) which is then cooled to 10\u00b0 C. The reaction mixture is transferred slowly into the water by vacuum, maintaining the internal temperature of the mixture below 25\u00b0 C. Hexanes (3 vol) is added and the resulting mixture is stirred for 0.5 h. The phases were settled and the aqueous phase (pH<1) was drained off and discarded.

The silica pad was washed with 30% ethyl acetate/heptane (5 vol) and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to afford benzyl protected (R)-1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-N-(1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-6-fluoro-2-(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-1H-indol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide as viscous reddish orange oil, and used directly in the next step. Synthesis of (R)-1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-N-(1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-6-fluoro-2-(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-1H-indol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide Method A A 20 L autoclave was flushed three times with nitrogen gas and then charged with palladium on carbon (Evonik E 101 NN/W, 5% Pd, 60% wet, 200 g, 0.075 mol, 0.04 equiv). The autoclave was then flushed with nitrogen three times. A solution of crude benzyl protected (R)-1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-N-(1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-6-fluoro-2-(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-1H-indol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide (1.3 kg, \u02dc1.9 mol) in THF (8 L, 6 vol) was added to the autoclave via suction. The vessel was capped and then flushed three times with nitrogen gas. With gentle stirring, the vessel was flushed three times with hydrogen gas, evacuating to atmosphere by diluting with nitrogen. The autoclave was pressurized to 3 Bar with hydrogen and the agitation rate was increased to 800 rpm. Rapid hydrogen uptake was observed (dissolution). Once uptake subsided, the vessel was heated to 50\u00b0 C. For safety purposes, the thermostat was shut off at the end of every work-day. The vessel was pressurized to 4 Bar with hydrogen and then isolated from the hydrogen tank. After 2 full days of reaction, more Pd/C (60 g, 0.023 mol, 0.01 equiv) was added to the mixture. This was done by flushing three times with nitrogen gas and then adding the catalyst through the solids addition port. Resuming the reaction was done as before. After 4 full days, the reaction was deemed complete by HPLC by the disappearance of not only the starting material but also of the peak corresponding to a mono-benzylated intermediate. The reaction mixture was filtered through a Celite pad. The vessel and filter cake were washed with THF (2 L, 1.5 vol). The Celite pad was then wetted with water and the cake discarded appropriately. The combined filtrate and THF wash were concentrated using a rotary evaporator yielding the crude product as a black oil, 1 kg. The equivalents and volumes in the following purification are based on 1 kg of crude material. The crude black oil was dissolved in 1:1 ethyl acetate-heptane. The mixture was charged to a pad of silica gel (1.5 kg, 1.5 wt. equiv) in a fritted funnel that had been saturated with 1:1 ethyl acetate-heptane. The silica pad was flushed first with 1:1 ethyl acetate-heptane (6 L, 6 vol) and then with pure ethyl acetate (14 L, 14 vol). The eluent was collected in 4 fractions which were analyzed by HPLC. The equivalents and volumes in the following purification are based on 0.6 kg of crude material. Fraction 3 was concentrated by rotary evaporation to give a brown foam (600 g) and then redissolved in MTBE (1.8 L, 3 vol). The dark brown solution was stirred overnight at ambient temperature, during which time, crystallization occurred. Heptane (55 mL, 0.1 vol) was added and the mixture was stirred overnight. The mixture was filtered using a Buchner funnel and the filter cake was washed with 3:1 MTBE-heptane (900 mL, 1.5 vol). The filter cake was air-dried for 1 h and then vacuum dried at ambient temperature for 16 h, furnishing 253 g of (R)-1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-N-(1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-6-fluoro-2-(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-1H-indol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide as an off-white solid. The equivalents and volumes for the following purification are based on 1.4 kg of crude material. Fractions 2 and 3 from the above silica gel filtration as well as material from a previous reaction were combined and concentrated to give 1.4 kg of a black oil. The mixture was resubmitted to the silica gel filtration (1.5 kg of silica gel, eluted with 3.5 L, 2.3 vol of 1:1 ethyl acetate-heptane then 9 L, 6 vol of pure ethyl acetate) described above, which upon concentration gave a tan foamy solid (390 g). The equivalents and volumes for the following purification are based on 390 g of crude material. The tan solid was insoluble in MTBE, so was dissolved in methanol (1.2 L, 3 vol). Ussing a 4 L Morton reactor equipped with a long-path distillation head, the mixture was distilled down to 2 vol. MTBE (1.2 L, 3 vol) was added and the mixture was distilled back down to 2 vol. A second portion of MTBE (1.6 L, 4 vol) was added and the mixture was distilled back down to 2 vol. A third portion of MTBE (1.2 L, 3 vol) was added and the mixture was distilled back down to 3 vol. Analysis of the distillate by GC revealed it to consist of \u02dc6% methanol. The thermostat was set to 48\u00b0 C. (below the boiling temp of the MTBE-methanol azeotrope, which is 52\u00b0 C.). The mixture was cooled to 20\u00b0 C. over 2 h, during which time a relatively fast crystallization occurred. After stirring the mixture for 2 h, heptane (20 mL, 0.05 vol) was added and the mixture was stirred overnight (16 h). The mixture was filtered using a Buchner funnel and the filter cake was washed with 3:1 MTBE-heptane (800 mL, 2 vol). The filter cake was airdried for 1 h and then vacuum dried at ambient temperature for 16 h, furnishing 130 g of (R)-1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-N-(1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-6-fluoro-2-(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-1H-indol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxanide as an off-white solid.

Benzyl protected (R)-1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-N-(1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-6-fluoro-2-(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-1H-indol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide was redissolved in THF (4 vol) and added to the hydrogenator containing 5 wt % Pd/C (2.5 mol %, 60% wet, Degussa E5 E101 NN/W). The internal temperature of the reaction was adjusted to 50\u00b0 C., and flushed with N2 (\u00d75) followed by hydrogen (\u00d73). The hydrogenator pressure was adjusted to 3 Bar of hydrogen and the mixture was stirred rapidly (>1100 rpm). At the end of the reaction, the catalyst was filtered through a pad of Celite and washed with THF (1 vol). The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to obtain a brown foamy residue. The resulting residue was dissolved in MTBE (5 vol) and 0.5N HCl solution (2 vol) and distilled water (1 vol) were added. The mixture was stirred for NLT 30 min and the resulting layers were separated. The organic phase was washed with 10 wt % K2CO3 solution (2 vol\u00d72) followed by a brine wash. The organic layer was added to a flask containing silica gel (25 wt %), Deloxan-THP II (5 wt %, 75% wet), and Na2SO4 and stirred overnight. The resulting mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite and washed with 10% THF/MTBE (3 vol). The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to afford crude (R)-1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-N-(1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-6-fluoro-2-(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-1H-indol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide as pale tan foam.

A solution of Dess-Martin periodinane (0.3 Min DCM, 12.8 mmol, 1.1 equiv) was added at ambient temperature. The mixture was stirred until the reaction was deemed complete by HPLC. A 5% aqueous solution of sodium sulfite was added and the mixture was stirred for up to 4 h. The phases were separated and then the organic phase was washed with 1 N HCl, brine and was then concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue was purified by chromatography. The yield of purified material was between 7 and 15%.

Synthesis of (R)-2-(5-(1-(2,2-difluoro benzo[d) [1,3]dioxol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamido)-1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-6-fluoro-1H-indol-2-yl)-2-methylpropanoic acid 3.62 g of 1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-N-((4R)-8-fluoro-2-hydroxy-4-(hydroxymethyl)-1,1-dimethyl-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-[1,4]oxazepino[4,5-a]indol-9-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide was charged in a 1 L flask along with 600 mL of toluene and stirred to dissolution. 14.5 g of Ag2CO3 in Celite. The heterogenous suspension was heated to 90\u00b0 C. and held for 7 hours at this temperature. The suspension was then allowed to cool naturally to ambient temperatures and filtered over celite. The celite was washed with ethyl acetate until no product comes off by HPLC, giving 1.24 g of a crude lactone. Purification of the crude lactone was done by flash chromatography. A flash column was loaded with 22 g of silica. Ussing 35:65 (ethylacetate-hexanes), 15-20 mL fractions were collected. Combining lactone enriched fractions gave 860 mg of crude lactone. The 860 mg of crude lactone was dissolved in 6 mL of ethyl acetate. 2N NaOH was added portion-wise while simultaneously monitoring HPLC for completion of hydrolysis (<5% of lactone remaining). It required 1.3 mL of 2N NaOH for completion of hydrolysis (<5% of lactone remaining). pH of aq=10-11. The pH was lowered to 3-4 by adding 0.5 mL of 2N HCl. The biphasic mixture was stirred for 15 minutes and the layers were allowed to settle. The organic layer containing the product (HPLC of the aqueous layer does not show product) was washed with 3 mL of H2O, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to yield 435 mg of (R)-2-(5-(1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamido)-1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-6-fluoro-1H-indol-2-yl)-2-methylpropanoic acid. LC/MS M+1=535.14. Alternative Synthesis of (R)-2-(5-(1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamido)-1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-6-fluoro-1H-Indol-2-yl)-2-methylpropanoic acid Step 1. Preparation of (R)-1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-N-(1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-6-fluoro-2-(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-1H-indol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide (50 g, 1.0 eq) was suspended in dichloromethane (700 mL, 14 vol) and then cooled to \u221210\u00b0 C. Solid carbonyl diimidazole (CDI, 34.2 g, 2.2 eq) was added. The reaction was monitored for completion by HPLC. Water (1 L, 20 vol) was added to the mixture and the phases were allowed to separate. The organic phase was solvent swapped into THF and the total volume was adjusted to 500 mL (10 vol). 2 M HCl (400 mL, 8 vol) was added to the THF solution. The mixture was stirred until all peaks coalesced into a single peak by HPLC (approximately 4 h). Toluene (700 mL, 14 vol) was added to the mixture, causing phase separation. The organic phase was washed with water (400 mL, 8 vol). The organic phase was concentrated at reduced pressure to give a light tan foam. The foam was suspended in isopropyl acetate (IPA, 700 mL, 14 vol) and heated to 80\u00b0 C. n-Heptane (236 mL, 4.7 vol) was added at a rate to maintain the temperature at greater than 75\u00b0 C. The mixture was cooled to 20\u00b0 C. at a rate of 10-15\u00b0 C. per hour. Crystallization occurred at approximately 65\u00b0 C. The mixture was then filtered. The solid was washed with 1:1 IPA-heptane (120 mL, 2.4 vol) and vacuum-dried at 55\u00b0 C. for 6 hours. Step 2. Preparation of The product from Step 1 was dissolved in dichloromethane (110 mL 20 vol) and then cooled to 10\u00b0 C. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (7.0 mL, 4 eq) was added to the mixture. A solution of SO3-pyridine complex (3.3 g, 2 eq) in DMSO (11 mL, 2 vol) was then added over a period of 20 minutes, at a rate to maintain internal reaction temperature between 0-10\u00b0 C. When the reaction was complete based on HPLC analysis, water (55 mL, 10 vol) was added to the mixture at a rate to maintain the internal temp between 0-10\u00b0 C. Some gas evolution was observed. The reaction mixture was then warmed to 25\u00b0 C. The phases were separated and the organic phase was washed with 1 M HCl (220 mL, 40 vol) and then NaHCO3 (220 mL, 40 vol). The mixture was concentrated at reduced pressure to give a white foam which was used without further purification. In an alternative procedure, the product from step 1 (43.5 g, 79.1 mmol) was dissolved in toluene (305 mL, 7 vol). The solution was concentrated to remove residual IPA. The residual solid was then dissolved in dichloromethane (305 mL, 7 vol). 2-Methyl-2-butene (11.2 g, 159 mmol, 2.0 eq), 2,4,6-Collidine (19.3 g, 159 mmol, 2.0 eq) and PhSNH-t-Bu (2.9 g, 16 mmol, 0.20 eq) were added. The mixture was cooled to \u22125-0\u00b0 C. N-Chlorosuccinimide (11.9 g, 89 mmol, 1.12 eq) was added in 0.5-1 g portions, maintaining the internal temp at less than 2\u00b0 C. Once the reaction was complete, aqueous HCl (2M, 151 mL, 3.5 vol) was added to the mixture. The mixture was stirred for 0.5 h while warming to ambient temperature. Agitation was stopped and the phases were separated. The organic phase was washed with 5% Na2SO3 (200 mL, 4.6 vol), and then water (200 mL, 4.6 vol). The organic phase was then concentrated down to an orange oil, which was taken up in isopropanol (270 mL, 6.2 vol). The mixture was heated to 71\u00b0 C. to dissolve the oil and then cooled to 40\u00b0 C. at a rate of approximately 10\u00b0 C./h and then to 25\u00b0 C. at a rate of 5\u00b0 C./h. The mixture was filtered using a Buchner funnel. The wet cake was washed with isopropanol (131 mL, 3 vol). The solid product was vacuum-dried at 65\u00b0 C. overnight. Step 3. Preparation of The aldehyde from Step 2 was dissolved in acetone (20 vol) and the mixture was cooled to 0\u00b0 C. Sodium permanganate (NaMnO4. 40% solution in water, 1.1 eq) was added slowly. The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC. When the reaction was complete based on HPLC analysis, water (10 vol) was added slowly as a solid precipitated out of solution. The mixture was filtered. The solid was washed with acetone. The combined acetone layers were concentrated to give the product as the sodium salt as an orange foam. In an alternative procedure, the aldehyde from step 2 (35 g, 64.3 mmol) was dissolved in acetone (21 0 mL, 6 vol). The mixture was concentrated to remove residual IPA. The residual foam was dissolved in acetone (350 mL, 10 vol) and the resulting solution was cooled to \u22125-0\u00b0 C. NaMnO4 (40 wt %, d=1.391 g/mL, 17.22 mL, 1.05 eq) was added in 10 equal portions, keeping the mixture temperature at less than 5\u00b0 C. The reaction mixture was stirred until complete by HPLC (approximately 30 min). Water (350 mL, 10 vol) and then Celite was added to the mixture slowly, controlling the temperature. The mixture was stirred at 0\u00b0 C. for 1 h and then was filtered through a Celite. The brown MnO2 wet cake was washed with 1:1 acetone water (150 mL, 4.3 vol). The acetone was removed from the combined filtrates by distillation. NaCl (approximately 17.5 g, 0.5 wt eq.) was added to the aqueous phase (approximately 5 wt % in water). The aqueous phase was extracted with 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (350 mL, 10 vol). The organic phase was azeotroped dry with 2-methyltetrahydrofuran until a suspension is observed. The mixture was concentrated to give a crude orange oil, which was suspended in ethanol (350 mL, 10 vol) and then stirred for 1 h. Afterwards, the mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite. The cake was washed with ethanol (70 mL, 2 vol). The solvent was swapped to acetonitrile, during which time, crystallization occurred. The mixture was filtered using a Buchner funnel. The product, a white solid, was washed with acetonitrile (70 mL, 2 vol) was vacuum-dried at 55\u00b0 C. overnight. Step 4. Preparation of (R)-2-(5-(1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamido)-1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-6-fluoro-1H-indol-2-yl)-2-methylpropanoic acid The product of Step 3 (5 g, 8.6 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (200 mL) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, 15 g, 17 eq) was added. The mixture was stirred until the reaction was complete as observed by HPLC, usually approximately 24 h. The reaction mixture was filtered using a Buchner funnel. The solvent was switched to water and the volume was adjusted to 50 mL (10 vol). Acetonitrile (50 mL, 10 vol) was added. The water in the mixture was slowly azeotroped out by vacuum-distillation at 35\u00b0 C. Acetonitrile was continually replaced in the still pot until solid material started to precipitate. The precipitate was filtered using a Buchner funnel. Filtrations were repeated until the product was pure by HPLC. The mixture was concentrated to give a light brown foam. The solid material was suspended in IPA and then was heated to 60\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. The suspension was cooled back to 25\u00b0 C. and then stirred for 1 hour. The mixture was filtered using a Buchner funnel and the cake was washed with IPA (10 mL, 2 vol). The solids were vacuum-dried at 60\u00b0 C. for at least 24 hours, or until the IPA content was less than 0.5 weight percent by 1H-NMR analysis. In an alternative procedure, the Na salt of the product of step 3 (17.5 g, 28 mmol, 1.0 eq) was dissolved in methanol (105 mL, 6 vol) and a hydrous sodium carbonate (15.1 g, 142 mmol, 5 eq) was added. The reaction mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite. The filter cake was washed with methanol (35 mL, 2 vol). The mixture was concentrated down to a final mass of 63 g. Acetonitrile (53 mL, 3 vol) was added to the mixture. The hazy solution was filtered using a Buchner funnel to give a clear solution. The mixture was distilled down to half-volume. Acetonitrile (70 mL, 4 vol) was added slowly to the mixture\u2014the product crystallized out within approximately 5 min. The last two steps can be repeated 1-2 additional times as needed. The mixture was then stirred for no less than 2 h. The white slurry was filtered using a Buchner funnel. The filter cake was washed with acetonitrile (35 mL, 2 vol). The solid product, the sodium salt, was vacuum-dried at 55\u00b0 C. overnight.

Assays for Detecting and Measuring M508-CFTR Correction Properties of Compounds Membrane potential optical methods for assaying \u0394F508-CFTR modulation properties of compounds. The assay utilizes fluorescent voltage sensing dyes to measure changes in membrane potential using a fluorescent plate reader (e.g., FLIPR III, Molecular Devices, Inc.) as a readout for increase in functional \u0394F508-CFTR in NIH 3T3 cells. The driving force for the response is the creation of a chloride ion gradient in conjunction with channel activation by a single liquid addition step after the cells have previously been treated with compounds and subsequently loaded with a voltage sensing dye. Identification of Correction Compounds To identify small molecules that correct the trafficking defect associated with \u02dcF508-CFTR; a single-addition HTS assay format was developed. Assay Plates containing cells are incubated for \u02dc2-4 hours in tissue culture incubator at 37\u00b0 C., S % CO2, 90% humidity. Cells are then ready for compound exposure after adhering to the bottom of the assay plates. The cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 16-24 hrs in tissue culture incubator at 37\u00b0 C., S % CO2, 90% humidity in the presence or absence (negative control) of test compound. The cells were subsequently rinsed 3\u00d7 with Krebs Ringers solution and loaded with a voltage sensing redistribution dye. To activate \u0394F508-CFTR, 10 \u03bcM forskolin and the CFTR potentiator, genistein (20 \u03bcM), were added along with cr-free medium to each well. The addition of Cl\u2212-free medium promoted Cl\u2212 efflux in response to \u0394F508-CFTR activation and the resulting membrane depolarization was optically monitored using voltage sensor dyes. Identification of Potentiator Compounds To identify potentiators of \u0394F508-CFTR, a double-addition HTS assay format was developed. This I-ITS assay utilizes fluorescent voltage sensing dyes to measure changes in membrane potential on the FLIPR III as a measurement for increase in gating (conductance) of \u0394F508 CFTR in temperature-corrected \u0394F508 CFTR NIH 3T3 cells. The driving force for the response is a Cl\u2212 ion gradient in conjunction with channel activation with forskolin in a single liquid addition step using a fluoresecent plate reader such as FLIPR III after the cells have previously been treated with potentiator compounds (or DMSO vehicle control) and subsequently loaded with a redistribution dye. Solutions: Bath Solution #1: (in mM) NaCl 160, KC14.5, CaCl2, 2. MgCl2 1, HEPES 10, pH 7.4 with NaOH. Chloride-free bath solution: Chloride salts in Bath Solution #1 are substituted with gluconate salts. Cell Culture NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing \u0394F508-CFTR are used for optical measurements of membrane potential. The cells are maintained at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO2 and 90% humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1\u00d7NEAA, \u03b2-ME, 1\u00d7 pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in 175 cm2 culture flasks. For all optical assays, the cells were seeded at \u02dc20,000/well in 384-well matrigel-coated plates and cultured for 2 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. before culturing at 27\u00b0 C. for 24 hrs. for the potentiator assay. For the correction assays, the cells are cultured at 27\u00b0 C. or 37\u00b0 C. with and without compounds for 16-24 hours. Electrophysiological Assays for assaying \u0394F508-CFTR modulation properties of compounds. 1. Ussing Chamber Assay Ussing chamber experiments were performed on polarized airway epithelial cells expressing \u0394F508-CFTR to further characterize the \u0394F508-CFTR modulators identified in the optical assays. Non-CF and CF airway epithelia were isolated from bronchial tissue, cultured as previously described (Galietta, L. J. V., Lantero, S., Gazzola, A., Sacco, O., Romano, L., Rossi, G. A., & Zegarra-Moran, O. (1998) In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 34, 478-481), and plated onto Costar\u00ae Snapwell\u2122 filters that were precoated with NIH3T3-conditioned media. After four days the apical media was removed and the cells were grown at an air liquid interface for >14 days prior to use. This resulted in a monolayer of fully differentiated columnar cells that were ciliated, features that are characteristic of airway epithelia. Non-CF HBE were isolated from non-smokers that did not have any known lung disease. CF-HBE were isolated from patients homozygous for \u0394F508-CFTR. HBE grown on Costar\u00ae Snapwell\u2122 cell culture inserts were mounted in an Ussing chamber (Physiologic Instruments. Inc., San Diego, Calif.), and the transepithelial resistance and short-circuit current in the presence of a basolateral to apical cr gradient (Isc) were measured using a voltage-clamp system (Department of Bioengineering, University of Iowa, Iowa). Briefly, HBE were examined under voltage-clamp recording conditions (Vhold=0 m V) at 37\u00b0 C. The basolateral solution contained (in mM) 145 NaCl, 0.83 K2HPO4, 3.3 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 CaCl2, 10 Glucose, 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.35 with NaOH) and the apical solution contained (in mM) 145 NaGluconate, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.35 with NaOH). Identification of Correction Compounds Typical protocol utilized a basolateral to apical membrane Cl\u2212 concentration gradient. To set up this gradient, normal ringer was used on the basolateral membrane, whereas apical NaCl was replaced by equimolar sodium gluconate (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH) to give a large cr concentration gradient across the epithelium. All experiments were performed with intact monolayers. To fully activate \u0394F508-CFTR, forskolin (10 \u03bcM), PDE inhibitor, IBMX (100 \u03bcM) and CFTR potentiator, genistein (50 \u03bcM) were added to the apical side. As observed in other cell types, incubation at low temperatures of FRT cells and human bronchial epithelial cells isolated from diseased CF patients (CF-HBE) expressing \u0394F508-CFTR increases the functional density of CFTR in the plasma membrane. To determine the activity of correction compounds, the cells were incubated with test compound for 24-48 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and were subsequently washed 3\u00d7 prior to recording. The cAMP- and genistein-mediated Isc in compound-treated cells was normalized to 37\u00b0 C. controls and expressed as percentage activity of CFTR activity in wt-HBE. Preincubation of the cells with the correction compound significantly increased the cAMP- and genistein-mediated Isc compared to the 37\u00b0 C. controls. Identification of Potentiator Compounds Typical protocol utilized a basolateral to apical membrane Cl\u2212 concentration gradient. To set up this gradient, normal ringers was used on the basolateral membrane, whereas apical NaCl was replaced by equimolar sodium gluconate (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH) to give a large cr concentration gradient across the epithelium. Forskolin (10 \u03bcM) and all test compounds were added to the apical side of the cell culture inserts. The efficacy of the putative \u0394F508-CFTR potentiators was compared to that of the known potentiator, genistein. 2. Patch-Clamp Recordings Total Cl\u2212 current in \u0394F508-NIH3T3 cells was monitored using the perforated-patch recording configuration as previously described (Rae, J., Cooper, K., Gates. P., & Watsky, M. (1991) J. Neurosci. Methods 37, 15-26). Voltage-clamp recordings were performed at 22\u00b0 C. using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, Calif.). The pipette solution contained (in mM) 150 N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG)-Cl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 240 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin-B (pH adjusted to 7.35 with HCl). The extracellular medium contained (in mM) 150 NMDG-Cl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2. 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.35 with HCl). Pulse generation, data acquisition, and analysis were performed using a PC equipped with a Digidata 1320 A/D interface in conjunction with Clampex 8 (Axon Instruments Inc.). To activate \u0394F508-CFTR, 10 \u03bcM forskolin and 20 M genistein were added to the bath and the current-voltage relation was monitored every 30 sec. Identification of Correction Compounds To determine the activity of correction compounds for increasing the density of functional \u0394F508-CFTR in the plasma membrane, we used the above-described perforated patch-recording techniques to measure the current density following 24-hr treatment with the correction compounds. To fully activate \u0394F508-CFTR, 10 \u03bcM forskolin and 20 \u03bcM genistein were added to the cells. Under our recording conditions, the current density following 24-hr incubation at 27\u00b0 C. was higher than that observed following 24-hr incubation at 37\u00b0 C. These results are consistent with the known effects of low-temperature incubation on the density of \u0394F508-CFTR in the plasma membrane. To determine the effects of correction compounds on CFTR current density, the cells were incubated with 10 \u03bcM of the test compound for 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and the current density was compared to the 27\u00b0 C. and 37\u00b0 C. controls (% activity). Prior to recording, the cells were washed 3\u00d7 with extracellular recording medium to remove any remaining test compound. Preincubation with 10 M of correction compounds significantly increased the cAMP- and genistein-dependent current compared to the 37\u00b0 C. controls. Identification of Potentiator Compounds The ability of \u0394F508-CFTR potentiators to increase the macroscopic \u0394F508-CFTR cr current (I\u0394F508) in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing \u0394F508-CFTR was also investigated using perforated-patch-recording techniques. The potentiators identified from the optical assays evoked a dose-dependent increase in I\u0394IF508 with similar potency and efficacy observed in the optical assays. In all cells examined, the reversal potential before and during potentiator application was around \u221230 mV, which is the calculated ECl (\u221228 mV). Cell Culture NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing \u0394F508-CFTR are used for whole-cell recordings. The cells are maintained at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO2 and 90% humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1\u00d7 NEAA, \u03b2-ME, 1\u00d7 pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in 175 cm2 culture flasks. For whole-cell recordings, 2,500-5,000 cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips and cultured for 24-48 hrs at 27\u00b0 C. before use to test the activity of potentiators; and incubated with or without the correction compound at 37\u00b0 C. for measuring the activity of correctors. 3. Single-Channel Recordings Gating activity of wt-CFTR and temperature-corrected \u0394F508-CFTR expressed in NIH3T3 cells was observed using excised inside-out membrane patch recordings as previously described (Dalemans, W., Barbry, P., Champigny, G., Jallat, S., Dott, K., Ireyer, D., Crystal. R. G., Pavirani, A., Lecocq, J-P., Lazdunski, M. (1991) Nature 354, 526-528) using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc.). The pipette contained (in mM): 150 NMDG, 150 aspartic acid, 5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.35 with Tris base). The bath contained (in mM): 150 NMDG-Cl, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 TES, and 14 Tris base (pH adjusted to 7.35 with HCl). After excision, both wt- and \u0394F508-CFTR were activated by adding 1 mM Mg-ATP, 75 nM of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA; Promega Corp. Madison, Wis.), and 10 mM NaF to inhibit protein phosphatases, which prevented current rundown. The pipette potential was maintained at 80 mV. Channel activity was analyzed from membrane patches containing \u22662 active channels. The maximum number of simultaneous openings determined the number of active channels during the course of an experiment. To determine the single-channel current amplitude, the data recorded from 120 sec of \u0394F508-CFTR activity was filtered \u201coff-line\u201d at 100 Hz and then used to construct all-point amplitude histograms that were fitted with multigaussian functions using Bio-Patch Analysis software (Bio-Logic Comp. France). The total microscopic current and open probability (P0) were determined from 120 sec of channel activity. The P0 was determined using the Bio-Patch software or from the relationship P0=I/i(N), where I=mean current, i=single-channel current amplitude, and N=number of active channels in patch. Cell Culture NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing \u0394F508-CFTR are used for excised membrane patch-clamp recordings. The cells are maintained at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO2 and 90% humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1\u00d7NEAA, \u03b2-ME, 1\u00d7 pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in 175 cm2 culture flasks. For single channel recordings, 2,500-5,000 cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips and cultured for 24-48 hrs at 27\u00b0 C. before use.
