    "patent_description": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a production method for an ellagic acid composition. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Ellagic acid is a compound which is contained in plants such as strawberry, apple, guava, and tara and which has a polyphenol structure. Ellagic acid is known to have physiological functions such as a whitening effect and an antioxidant effect. However, ellagic acid has low solubility in water and is hardly used in an aqueous product. Accordingly, a technology for solubilizing ellagic acid in water has been investigated, and for example, an \u03b1-glycoside obtained by bonding one or more molecules of a sugar to ellagic acid (Patent Document 1) has been reported. There has also been reported a method involving forming fine particles of ellagic acid by a mixing with a crystal growth inhibitor and a water-soluble polymer to disperse the particles stably (Patent Document 2). Meanwhile, based on recent health trends, an \u03b1-amylase inhibitory action of a guava leaf extract solution has attracted attention, and for example, soft drinks each containing a guava leaf extract solution or the like have been developed (for example, Patent Documents 3 and 4). The guava leaf extract solution contains ellagic acid, and forms precipitates at room temperature due to its poor solubility in water. Accordingly, in order to suppress deterioration of appearance of a drink, there have been proposed, for example, a method involving removing fine crystal nuclei of free ellagic acid from a guava leaf extract solution by microfiltration (Patent Document 3) and a method involving extracting guava leaves with hot water at from 90 to 98\u00b0 C., concentrating the extract thus obtained to a Brix sugar content of from 20 to 30, and subjecting the resultant concentrate to freeze drying (Patent Document 4). CITATION LIST Patent Document [Patent Document 1] JP-A-2005-281204 [Patent Document 2] JP-A-2003-81826 [Patent Document 3] JP-A-2003-208 [Patent Document 4] WO 2007/135767 A1 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a production method for an ellagic acid composition, comprising the steps of: mixing an aqueous medium with a raw material which contains a guava leaf extract and which contains, in solids thereof, 1 to 5% by mass of free ellagic acid to prepare a material for heat treatment; and subjecting the material for heat treatment to heat treatment at from 100\u00b0 C. to 180\u00b0 C., and an ellagic acid composition obtained by the production method. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION An \u03b1-glycoside of ellagic acid has high solubility in water but is expensive because of cumbersome production steps. In the method of Patent Document 2, involving using a crystal growth inhibitor such as a phosphate, there may be a problem in that an application is limited due to deterioration of the taste and flavor. Meanwhile, in the methods of Patent Documents 3 and 4, each involving treating a guava leaf extract solution, there may be a problem in that free ellagic acid having not been dissolved in a solvent for extraction is removed to cause failure of effective use of ellagic acid itself, or ellagic acid to be obtained has insufficient solubility in water. Therefore, the present invention relates to providing a production method for an ellagic acid composition excellent in solubility in water. The inventors of the present invention made various investigations on technologies for solubilizing ellagic acid, and found that solubility of ellagic acid in water is not improved even by subjecting only free ellagic acid to heat treatment at 100\u00b0 C. or more in the presence of an aqueous medium, while the concentration of ellagic acid dissolved in water is remarkably increased by subjecting free ellagic acid to heat treatment at 100\u00b0 C. or more together with a guava leaf extract. They also found that, when a composition having been subjected to the heat treatment is subjected to spray drying or freeze drying, the composition can be dried while maintaining high solubility in water, thereby obtaining an ellagic acid composition excellent in solubility in water. According to the present invention, the concentration of free ellagic acid dissolved in water can be increased, and an ellagic acid composition excellent in solubility can be produced at a low cost. The present invention provides a production method for an ellagic acid composition, comprising the steps of: mixing an aqueous medium with a raw material which contains a guava leaf extract and which contains, in solids thereof, 1 to 5% by mass of free ellagic acid to prepare a material for heat treatment; and subjecting the material for heat treatment to heat treatment at from 100 to 180\u00b0 C.

In addition, the pressure is preferably set to a pressure equal to or higher than a saturated vapor pressure of water. The pressurization may be carried out using a gas, and examples of the gas to be used include an inert gas, water vapor, nitrogen gas, and helium gas or the like. The pressurization may be carried out by adjusting the pressure with a back pressure valve without using the gas. The heat treatment may be carried out by, for example, any of a batch method, a semi-batch method, a flow reaction method, and the like. Of those, a flow reaction method is preferred because the reaction time can be easily controlled. The time for the heat treatment is preferably from 0.1 minute to 30 minutes, more preferably from 0.2 minute to 15 minutes, even more preferably from 0.5 minute to 8 minutes after the temperature of the aqueous medium reaches a predetermined temperature, from the viewpoints of improving the solubility of ellagic acid and thermal stability. When the heat treatment is carried out by the flow reaction method, a mean residence time calculated by dividing a volume of a high-temperature and high-pressure part of the reactor by a supply rate of the aqueous medium is employed as the time for the heat treatment. When the heat treatment is carried out by the flow reaction method, the flow rate of the aqueous medium depends on the volume of the reactor, and is, for example, preferably from 3.3 to 200 mL/min, more preferably from 6.7 to 150 mL/min, when the reactor has a volume of 100 mL.

As the cooling rate becomes larger, the solubility of free ellagic acid can be improved more. Therefore, the upper limit of the cooling rate is not particularly specified, and is, for example, preferably 100\u00b0 C./s or less, more preferably 50\u00b0 C./s or less, from the viewpoint of, for example, restriction on production facility or the like. The production method of the present invention preferably further includes the step of removing an undissolved residual solid portion from the heat-treated solution, from the viewpoint of improving the solubility of an ellagic acid composition to be obtained. A method of removing the solid portion is not particularly limited, and may be, for example, centrifugation, decantation, or filtration. The ellagic acid composition of the present invention may have a form of an aqueous solution, or a form of a paste, which is obtained by adjusting the water content. In addition, the composition may have a form of a solid matter, such as a powder, a granule, or a solid, which is obtained by removing water. As means for adjusting the water content or removing water, there are given, for example, freeze drying, evaporation to dryness, and spray drying or the like. When the heat-treated solution is subjected to freeze drying or spray drying, the resultant heat-treated solution is preferably subjected to spray drying or freeze drying within 300 minutes after completion of the heat treatment, from the viewpoint of increasing the yield of ellagic acid. Of those, spray drying is preferred because the treatment can be completed in a short time. The phrase \u201cwithin 300 minutes\u201d after completion of the heat treatment refers to a time between the time of completion of the heat treatment, i.e., from the time when the temperature of the heat-treated solution is lowered to less than 100\u00b0 C. to the time of start of spray drying or freeze drying. The time from completion of the heat treatment to start of spray drying or freeze drying is preferably 240 minutes or less, more preferably 150 minutes or less, more preferably 120 minutes or less, even more preferably 60 minutes or less, and is preferably from 0.1 minute to 150 minutes, more preferably from 0.1 minute to 60 minutes, from the viewpoint of increasing the yield of ellagic acid. A method for the spray drying or the freeze drying is not particularly limited, and a known method is applicable thereto. For example, the spray drying may be carried out by spraying the heat-treated solution from a nozzle to drop the solution through hot air at from 100 to 220\u00b0 C., preferably from 130 to 190\u00b0 C. In addition, the freeze drying may be carried out by freezing the heat-treated solution with liquid nitrogen or in a cooling bath, a freezer, or the like, pulverizing and sieving the resultant, and sublimating water in a vacuum. The temperature for freezing the heat-treated solution is preferably from \u221270 to 0\u00b0 C. The absolute pressure during drying is preferably from 0.1 to 1,000 Pa, more preferably from 0.5 to 100 Pa, even more preferably from 1 to 10 Pa. The heat-treated solution may be subjected to spray drying or freeze drying after concentration. As a method of concentrating the heat-treated solution, a general method such as concentration under reduced pressure may be employed. After the spray drying or the freeze drying, the dried product may be subjected to classification, granulation, pulverization, or the like, if necessary. The ellagic acid composition thus obtained is suppressed from precipitating free ellagic acid even at room temperature, and is excellent in solubility in water. The solubility of free ellagic acid in water (25\u00b0 C.) in the ellagic acid composition thus obtained is preferably 0.05 g/L or more, more preferably 0.08 g/L or more, even more preferably 0.15 g/L or more. According to the production method of the present invention, free ellagic acid can be dissolved in water at a solubilization ratio of from 30 to 100%, more preferably from 45 to 100%, more preferably from 60 to 100%, more preferably from 65 to 100%, even more preferably from 80 to 100%. It should be noted that the solubilization ratio of free ellagic acid can be calculated by an equation described in Examples below. In addition, the production method of the present invention has less effect on taste and flavor. Therefore, the ellagic acid composition of the present invention may be used in various foods and drinks and pharmaceutical products or the like. Examples of the foods and drinks include liquid, solid, or semi-solid foods and drinks, such as drinks, bread, noodles, confectionery, e.g., a cookie, a snack, jelly, a dairy product, a frozen food, an instant food, e.g., powder coffee, a processed starch product, a processed meat product, any other processed food, a seasoning, and a nutritional supplement.

A 0.05 mol/L aqueous solution of acetic acid was used as a mobile phase solution A, and acetonitrile was used as a mobile phase solution B, respectively, and they were delivered at 1.0 mL/min. Gradient conditions are shown below. Time (min) Solution A (%) Solution B (%) 0 99 1 10 90 10 20 85 15 40 10 90 50 10 90 50.1 85 15 60 85 15 The sample injection volume was 10 \u03bcL, and quantification was carried out based on an absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm. pH Measurement Method The pH was measured using a pH meter (DKK-TOA Corporation, HM-30G) after the temperature of a sample was adjusted to 20\u00b0 C. Measurement of Amount of Free Ellagic Acid The amount of free ellagic acid in the material for heat treatment was determined by dissolving the material for heat treatment in dimethylsulfoxide, filtering the solution at 25\u00b0 C. with a hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene filter having a pore size of 0.2 \u221em, and measuring the concentration of ellagic acid dissolved.

Calculation of Solubilization Ratio Solubilization ratio (%) of free ellagic acid=[(Mass of free ellagic acid dissolved in water or aqueous medium)/(Mass of free ellagic acid in material for heat treatment)]\u00d7100 Example 1 5.0 g of guava leaf extract powder (manufactured by Matsuura Yakugyo Co., Ltd., free ellagic acid content: 2%) was added to 1,250 mL of distilled water to prepare a material for heat treatment, and the material for heat treatment was stirred homogeneously in a slurry supply tank. The material for heat treatment had a pH of 5.1. The concentration of solids and concentration of free ellagic acid in the material for heat treatment, and the concentration of free ellagic acid in solids of the raw material are as shown in Table 1. The solution in the slurry supply tank was fed to a stainless-steel flow reactor having an inner volume of 100 mL (manufactured by Nitto Koatsu Co., Ltd.) at 100 mL/min, and was subjected to heat treatment at 110\u00b0 C. (mean residence time: 1 minute). The pressure was adjusted to 0.3 MPa (gauge pressure) with an outlet valve. The heat-treated solution was discharged from the outlet of the reactor and cooled to room temperature (25\u00b0 C.) with a heat exchanger, and the pressure was returned to atmospheric pressure via the outlet valve, followed by recovery. The cooling rate determined from the time of cooling from 110\u00b0 C. to 90\u00b0 C. was 7.88\u00b0 C./s. A part of the heat-treated solution was sampled, and the amount of free ellagic acid dissolved in the aqueous medium was measured to determine a solubilization ratio. In addition, the pH of the heat-treated solution was measured. Subsequently, the heat-treated solution was subjected to preliminary freezing in a cooling bath at \u221250\u00b0 C., and 30 minutes after completion of the heat treatment, drying under reduced pressure using a freeze dryer (manufactured by CHRIST, ALPHA1-4LSC) was started. The drying was carried out at an absolute pressure of 1 Pa. 72 hours later, an ellagic acid composition was obtained in a powder form. The amount of free ellagic acid dissolved in water was measured using the ellagic acid composition powder to determine a solubilization ratio.
