    "patent_summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Thus, there is a need for improved drug formulations that can reduce or eliminate severe side effects and enhance the tolerability, efficacy, and/or compliance of the drug. More specifically, many pharmacological compounds having amine groups can benefit from conjugation to other molecules or moieties provided that the crosslinking group is cleavable in vivo to release the drug. Thus, there is a need for new crosslinkers having a functional group that can form a cleavable bond with amine-containing molecules upon exposure to esterases and/or under mild basic conditions (e.g., pH 7.4 to 9) in vivo. Cleavable cross-linkers, intermediates of cleavable cross-linkers, cleavable conjugates comprising the cleavable cross-linkers, and methods of synthesizing the cross-linkers, intermediates, and conjugates are disclosed. Therapeutic conjugates provided by the present disclosure comprising the cleavable cross-linkers can reduce the side effects, enhance the efficacy, and/or improve the convenience of treatment for the parent drug.

    "patent_description": "FIELD The disclosure relates to multi-functional crosslinkers capable of coupling primary or secondary amine-containing therapeutic agents to ligands. The multi-functional crosslinkers are cleavable upon exposure to esterases or to basic conditions to release the amine-containing therapeutic agents. The disclosure also relates to conjugates comprising the crosslinkers, a therapeutic agent, and a ligand. BACKGROUND Drugs can often cause severe side effects and/or require multiple dosing regimens. Some of these side effects and inconvenient dosing regimens can be controlled or reduced by the use of improved formulations and/or improved delivery methods. Paclitaxel, for example, is highly effective in treating breast and lung cancers by inhibiting the growth of cancer cells by binding to microtubules. However, because the drug has a low aqueous solubility, paclitaxel is typically formulated using the toxic solvent Cremophor\u00ae EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil), which limits the amount of drug that can be administered to a patient. Patients taking the drug often require premedication with steroids or antihistamines for hypersensitivity reactions caused by the solvent. Abraxane\u00ae, a new paclitaxel formulation, does not employ a toxic solvent. When formulated with human serum albumin, the drug can be suspended in aqueous media. Thus, patients can better tolerate higher paclitaxel doses (up to 260 m g/m2 vs. 175 g/m2) and thereby achieve an improved response rate. Doxorubicin is another highly effective cancer drug belonging to a class of anthracycline compounds. However, the drug can cause severe cardiotoxicity and death. Patients taking a cumulative dose of 300 mg/m2 have a 1-2% chance of developing cardiomyopathy, with the incidence increasing with increasing dose (400 mg/m2, 3-5%; 450 mg/m2, 5 to 8%; 500 mg/m2, 6-20%). The use of Doxil\u00ae, a pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, results in a reduced incidence of cardiotoxicity. Doxil\u00ae has a half-life in the blood of about 50 hours compared to about 10 minutes for doxorubicin. The slow-release of doxorubicin may explain the lower toxicity of the Doxil\u00ae formulation. Myocet\u00ae, a non-pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, also reduces the incidence of cardiotoxicity. Furthermore, its use also reduces the incidence of hand-foot syndrome associated with Doxil\u00ae. Myocet\u00ae is approved in Europe and is being evaluated in the United States. Mitoxantrone is used for the treatment of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. It is also indicated for reducing neurologic disability and/or the frequency of clinical relapses in patients with secondary (chronic) progressive, progressive relapsing, or worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Although one of the most effective drugs for treating MS, mitoxantrone is not recommended for long-term use. Patients who exceed a cumulative dose of 140 mg/m2 have an increased risk of acquiring irreversible cardiotoxicity and death. There is no liposomal formulation of this drug. Bleomycin, in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, is effective in treating squamous cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and testicular carcinoma. However, patients taking a cumulative dose of 400 units (\u02dc400 mg) risk developing pulmonary fibrosis. Mertansine, a derivative of maytansine, is an experimental cytotoxic agent. Because of its extreme toxicity, it is not used as a stand-alone therapeutic agent. To minimize side effects and to maximize efficacy, the compound is conjugated to tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies such as lorvotuzumab and trastuzumab. Vedotin, an auristatin, is another potent cytotoxic agent. To minimize side effects and to maximize efficacy, it is conjugated to tumor-targeting monoclonal antibody brentuximab. Recombinant interferon alfa-2a (Roferon\u00ae A) is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, hairy cell leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. The recommended dosing regimen for Roferon\u00ae A for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C is three times per week administered subcutaneously for 12 months. Pegasys\u00ae, a pegylated formulation of interferon alfa-2a, requires less frequent dosing. The recommended dosing regimen for Pegasys\u00ae for treating chronic hepatitis C is once weekly for 48 weeks by subcutaneous administration. Zalbin\u00ae, an interferon alfa-2b conjugated to human serum albumin, is an alternative to unconjugated interferon alfa-2b (Intron\u00ae A). Instead of subcutaneously or intramuscularly dosing the non-conjugated drug three times a week for up to 24 months, Zalbin\u00ae is administered only once every two weeks. Enfuvirtide, an FDA-approved HIV drug, is a fusion inhibitor having a linear 36-amino acid synthetic peptide. Due to its short half-life of four hours, treatment requires twice-daily subcutaneous injections. This inconvenient dosing schedule discourages its widespread use. SUMMARY Thus, there is a need for improved drug formulations that can reduce or eliminate severe side effects and enhance the tolerability, efficacy, and/or compliance of the drug. More specifically, many pharmacological compounds having amine groups can benefit from conjugation to other molecules or moieties provided that the crosslinking group is cleavable in vivo to release the drug. Thus, there is a need for new crosslinkers having a functional group that can form a cleavable bond with amine-containing molecules upon exposure to esterases and/or under mild basic conditions (e.g., pH 7.4 to 9) in vivo. Cleavable cross-linkers, intermediates of cleavable cross-linkers, cleavable conjugates comprising the cleavable cross-linkers, and methods of synthesizing the cross-linkers, intermediates, and conjugates are disclosed. Therapeutic conjugates provided by the present disclosure comprising the cleavable cross-linkers can reduce the side effects, enhance the efficacy, and/or improve the convenience of treatment for the parent drug.

Example 9 In Vitro Cytotoxicity The effect of compounds provided by the present disclosure on cancer cell growth and viability is measured in a panel of human cancer cells grown in vitro. All cancer cell lines are obtained, for example, from the American Tissue Type Collection (ATTC). Cells are maintained in the following media: TUR, H69AR, Calu-6, ME180, and PC3 cells are grown in RPMI medium containing 4.5 g/L glucose, 10% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate); and HT29 cells are grown in DMEM with 4.5 g/L glucose, 10% FBS, and 6 mM/L-glutamine. All cells are grown at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO2 and passaged bi-weekly. For cytoxicity studies, cells are seeded into 96-well clear-bottom microtiter plates at the following densities: TUR (7,500 cells/well), HT29 (5,000 cells/well), H69AR (10,000 cells/well), Calu-6 (15,000 cells/well), and ME180 (2,500 cells/well). Cells are maintained at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO2 for 24 hours prior to addition of a test compound. Each condition is measured in triplicate. For compounds dissolved in DMSO, the final DMSO concentration in each well and in the non-drug treated control cells is constant and below 1% in all studies. The number of viable cells is determined after 24, 48, and 72 hours using Alamar blue fluorescence. Briefly, Alamar blue (10 mM) is added to each well for 4 hours, and the number of viable cells estimated by measuring the fluorescence of reduced Alamar blue (530 nm excitation, 590 nm emission). To correct for background fluorescence, cells are treated with 100% DMSO to eliminate all viable cells. The effect of a test compound on cell growth is determined by calculating the fraction of live cells treated with the test compound compared to untreated cells: (F1 drug treated\u2212F1 DMSO killed)/(F1 untreated\u2212F1 DMSO killed). The half maximal growth inhibition value (GI50) is calculated using commercial curve-fitting software (e.g., Prism). Example 10 Efficacy in Xenograph Model Tumor xenograft studies are performed using nude athymic CD-1 mice (for example, from Charles River Laboratories). Human cancer cells (5\u00d7106 PC3, 5\u00d7106 HT29, 107 Calu-6, and 5\u00d7106 ME180) are implanted in the hind flank of nude mice. Tumor growth is measured using calipers and tumor volume calculated using the formula: (width 2\u00d7(length/2)). Tumor volume is measured 3 days per week. Animal weight is measured 3 days per week to assess compound toxicity. Compounds are tested for in vivo tumor growth inhibition as follows. Animals bearing tumors (100-200 mg) are sorted into groups (5-8 animals) with similar average tumor mass per group. Drug doses are administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection (0.5 mL). Test compounds are dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with the concentration adjusted for animal weight. Actual drug concentrations in formulated doses are verified by quantitative nitrogen detection. Animals are dosed every 7 days for 21 days in most studies. In several studies, animals are dosed twice weekly (days 0, 4, 7, 10, 14, etc.). Tumor volume and animal weight are measured on days 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, and 28. At the end of the study, animal blood is removed for analysis of liver and kidney function (BUN, creatine, AST and ALT; analytical measurements performed by Quality Clinical Labs). Tumor volume at the end of the study is calculated as a percentage of the tumor volume on day 0. The percent tumor growth inhibition is obtained from the ratio of the percentage tumor volume increase in drug treated animals to the percentage tumor volume increase in saline treated animals. Finally, it should be noted that there are alternative ways of implementing the disclosures contained herein. Accordingly, the present embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the claims are not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope and equivalents thereof.",
