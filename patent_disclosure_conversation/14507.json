The guide portion 14C has a portion that extends to both sides in the width direction no as to fit into the wide portion 24C. With this arrangement, the second support portion 14 is prevented from falling out upward in FIG. 5, The second support portion 14 is movably attached to the rail 24 and, thus, can move with respect to the frame F of the bicycle B. The length and mounting position of the rails 24 are set to be suitable for the battery to be mounted. Specifically, the end portion of the rail 24 in the longitudinal direction on the opposite side of the first support portion 12 is attached to the frame F so as to be in a position that is farther away from the first support portion 12 than the second supporting position PB, which is suitable for a battery that can be mounted. Additionally, the end portion of the rail 24 on the first support portion 12 side is attached to the frame F so as to be in a position that is farther on the side with the first support portion 12 than the second supporting position PB, which is suitable for a battery that can be mounted. The second supporting position PB suitable for the battery, for example, is determined on the basis of a state in which only a first battery 40X is mounted, as shown in FIG. 9, a state in which a battery BT that is larger than the first battery 40X is mounted, as shown in FIG. 10, or a state in which two batteries 40X and 40Y are mounted, as shown in FIG. 2. As shown in FIG. 5, the securing structure 26 comprises two brackets 28, a shaft 30, an eccentric cam 32 and an operating unit 33. The two brackets 28 are each attached to both sides 14A and 14B of the second support portion 14. A protrusion 28A is formed on each of the lower ends of the two brackets 28. Each of the protrusions 28A can be fitted into a recess 24A that is formed on the sides of the rails 24. As shown in FIG. 2, several recesses 24A are provided along the rails 24 at predetermined intervals. The second supporting position PB can be modified between the recess 24A formed at one end portion in the longitudinal direction of the rails 24 and the recess 24A formed at the other end portion. Accordingly, the second supporting position PB can be discontinuously modified in accordance with the positions of the recesses 24A. The second supporting position PB can also be made to be continuously modifiable. For example, the brackets 28 can be configured without forming protrusions, the rails 24 can be configured without forming recesses 24A, and the second support portion 14 can be configured to be fixed to the rails 24 by the frictional force of the brackets 28 clamping the rails 24. With this configuration, the position of the second support portion 14 and the second supporting position PB with respect to the rails 24 can be modified continuously. As shown in FIG. 5, the shaft 30 extends through the second support portion 14 and the two brackets 28 in the width direction. A stopper 30A that is larger than the diameter of shaft 30 is attached to one end of the shaft 30. One of the brackets 28 is sandwiched between the stopper 30A and the first side 14A, which is one side of the second support portion 14 in the width direction. The eccentric cam 32 is attached to the other end of the shaft 30. The other bracket 28 is sandwiched between the eccentric cam 32 and the second side 14B, which is the other side of the second support portion 14 in the width direction. The eccentric cam 32 is mounted to the shaft 30 to be rotatable around the direction that is perpendicular to the axial direction of the shaft 30. The operating unit 33 is connected to the eccentric cam 32 and is used to move the rotational position of the eccentric cam 32 between the fixed position and the release position. When the rotational position of the eccentric cam 32 is in the fixed position, as shown by the solid line in FIG. 5, a cam surface 32A of the eccentric cam 32 presses the other bracket 28 to the second side 14B of the second support portion 14 and the side of the rail 24. Additionally, the stopper 30A presses one of the brackets 28 to the first side 14A of the second support portion 14 and the sides of the rails 24. With this, the position of the second support portion 14 is fixed with respect to the rails 24 and the frame F. When the rotational position of the eccentric cam 32 is at the release position, as shown by the double-dotted, chained line in FIG. 5, the cam surface 32A of the eccentric cam 32 separates from the other bracket 28. With this, the protrusions 28A of the two brackets 28 can be detached from the recesses 24A of the rails 24. Accordingly, the second support portion 14 becomes movable with respect to the rails 24. As shown in FIG. 4, the lock mechanism 18 comprises a cylinder lock 34, and a latch 36. The cylinder lock 34 is fixed to the second support portion 14. The latch 36 is retractable by the cylinder lock 34. The cylinder lock 34 can be turned with a key that is not shown. The latch 36 switches between states of protruding above the second support portion 14 and being housed in the second support portion 14, along with the turning of the cylinder lock 34, When protruding from the second support portion 14, the latch 36 fits into a hole 40C that is formed inside of the recess 40B of the battery unit 40. With this, the battery unit 40 is prevented from undesirably detaching from the second support portion 14. When not being retracted by the cylinder lock 34, the latch 36 is in a state of protruding above the second support portion 14 via an elastic member (diagram omitted). With this, when the latch 36 does not face the hole 40C, such as when adjusting the position in order to attach the battery unit 40 to the battery holder 10, the latch 36 is pushed downward by the bottom of the battery unit 40. And, when the battery unit 40 is mounted to the supporting position wherein the latch 36 faces the hole 40C, the latch 36 fits in the hole 40C.

The first terminal 44X of the first battery 40X is formed in the same shape as the first terminal 44 of the second battery 40Y. The first battery 40X comprises a third fitting portion 49A formed around the first terminal 44 with a concave shape, along with a recess 49B (see FIG. 9) that is similar to the recess 40B, at the first end portion 49 in one direction. The end portion 49 of the first battery 40X has the same shape as the end portion 42 of the second battery 40Y. When the first battery 40X is connected to the second fitting portion 46A, the first terminal 44X of the first battery 40X is connected to the second terminal 48. At this time, the electric power from the second battery 40Y can supply power to the drive unit D (see FIG. 1) of the bicycle B independent of the first battery 40X. Also, the electric power from the first battery 40X can supply power to the drive unit D (see FIG. 1) of the bicycle B independent of the second battery 40Y. By fitting the first fitting portion 42A into the fourth fitting portion 20A, the second battery 40Y is stably supported to the first support portion 12. The third fitting portion 49A has the same shape as the first fitting portion 42A. Therefore, when the second battery 40Y is detached, as shown in FIG. 9, the first terminal 44X and the terminal 22 are electrically connectable by fitting the third fitting portion 49A of the first battery 40X into the first fitting portion 42A of the battery holder 10. A first example of how to mount the first battery 40X and the second battery 40Y to the battery holder 10 will be described with reference to FIGS. 2 to 5. First, the operator operates the operating unit 33 and turns the eccentric ca to the release position. Then, the operator pulls out the protrusions 28A of the two brackets 28 from the recesses 24A of the rails 24. Then, the operator moves the second support portion 14 to match the distance between the end portion 42 and the recess 40B where the battery unit 40, which is the first battery 40X and the second battery 40Y combined, is mounted to the first support portion 12. Then, the operator fits the first fitting portion 42A of the second battery 40Y into the fourth fitting portion 20A of the first support portion 12. With this, the first terminal 44 makes contact with the terminal 22. Then, the operator fits the recess 40B of the first battery 40X into the second support portion 14 and locks this using the lock mechanism 18. Then, the operator moves the first battery 40X, along with the second support portion 14, in the direction that approaches the first support portion 12. At this time, the operator makes the first terminal 44 make contact with the second terminal 48 of the battery unit 40 while fitting the first fitting portion 42A of the second battery 40Y into the third fitting portion 49A of the first battery 40X. Then, the operator fits the protrusions 28A of the two brackets 28 into the recesses 24A, which are formed in the corresponding positions of the rails 24. Then, the operator operates the operating unit 33 and turns the eccentric cam 32 to the fixed position. Through these operations, the two batteries battery units 40 become supported by the battery holder 10. If the lengths of the first battery 40X and the second battery 40Y that will be coupled are predetermined, the rails 24 may be formed so that the second support portion 14 comes to the position that fits into the recesses 24A when the second support portion 14 is moved to the position that is most separated from the first support portion 12. Additionally, when mounting the same combination of batteries 40X and 40Y, from the second time on, the operation of moving the second support portion 14 can be omitted. Furthermore, marks corresponding to predetermined combinations of batteries 40X and 40Y may be provided on the rails 24, and the second support portion 14 may be moved to the position of the mark corresponding to the batteries 40X and 40Y that will be combined. A second example of how to mount the first battery 40X and the second battery 40Y to the battery holder 10 will be described with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3. In the second example of the mounting methods, the second support portion 14 is fixed to the rails 24 so that the second supporting position PB corresponds beforehand to the length of the battery unit 40 that will be mounted. First, the operator prepares the battery unit 40, which is in a state in which the third fitting portion 49A of the first battery 40X and the second fitting portion 46A of the second battery 40Y are fitted together. Then, the operator adjusts the positions of the recess 42B of the battery unit 40 and the guide portion 20B of the first support portion 12. At this time, the operator supports the battery unit 40 so that the opening of the recess 42B fits into the tip of the guide portion 20B, and the second battery 40Y is positioned farther outside of the frame F than the second support portion 14. Then, the operator swivels the battery unit 40 around the guide portion 20B, so that a contact portion 40D of the second battery 40Y moves along a groove 14E of the second support portion 14. Meanwhile, mounting a battery BT or only the first battery 40X to the battery holder 10 is also possible by using a second example of this mounting method. The action of the battery holder 10 will be explained with reference to FIGS. 2, 9 and 10. The second supporting position PB of the second support portion 14 of the battery holder 10 can be modified. Specifically, as shown in FIG. 2, when mounting a first battery 40X and a second battery 40Y on a bicycle B, the second supporting position PB is set to the position of a recess 40B of the first battery 40X on the side away from a first supporting position PA. As shown in FIG. 9, when mounting only the first battery 40X on the bicycle B, the second supporting position PB is set to the position of the recess 40B of the first battery 40X. Additionally, as shown in FIG. 10, when mounting a battery BT, which is larger than the first battery 40X, to the bicycle B, the second supporting position PB is set to the position of a recess BTX of the battery BT. Meanwhile, one end portion BTA of the battery BT comprises the same shape as the end portion 42 of the second battery 40Y. With this, the end portion BTA of the battery BT is supported by the first support portion 12. In this way, the battery holder 10 can support the number of batteries 40 that the rider desires or a battery BT that has a different size than the battery unit 40. With the battery holder 10 the following effects can be obtained. (1) The second supporting position PB of the battery holder 10 can be modified. For this reason, the number of batteries 40X and 40Y to be mounted on the bicycle B can be changed. Additionally, mounting the battery unit 40, the first battery 40X, and the battery BT, with different capacitances and weights, to the bicycle B is possible. For this reason, the usability can be improved. (2) The second support portion 14 is movable with respect to the bicycle B. For this reason, the second supporting position PB can be modified more easily, as compared to a configuration that modifies the second supporting position PB by attaching and detaching the second support portion 14 to and from the frame F. (3) The battery holder 10 comprises a moving mechanism 16, including at least one of the rails 24. For this reason, the second supporting position PB can be modified easily by sliding the second support portion 14 on the rails 24. (4) The moving mechanism 16 comprises a securing structure 26 that can secure the position of the second support portion 14 via the rotation of the eccentric cam 32. For this reason, the second support portion 14 can be easily moved, and the position of the second support portion 14 can be easily fixed. (5) The second support portion 14 has a convex shape that fits into the recess 40B of the battery unit 40. For this reason, the second support portion 14 can stably support the battery unit 40. (6) The second support portion 14 comprises a lock mechanism 18. For this reason, the battery unit 40 can be prevented from being detached from the second support portion 14. The following effects are obtained with the battery unit 40. (1) The battery unit 40 comprises a fitting portion 42A configured to be supportable via the battery holder 10, as well as a second fitting portion 46A that is connectable to another battery 40 in a portion besides the first fitting portion 42A. For this reason, since batteries 40 can be coupled and mounted to the battery holder 10, the user can mount a desired number of batteries 40 to the bicycle 13, improving usability. (2) The first terminal 44 of the battery unit 40 is connectable to the terminal 22 of the battery holder 10 and the second terminal 48 of another battery 40. For this reason, since the battery can be electrically connected to another battery 40 using the first terminal 44, the drive unit D can use a plurality of batteries 40 consecutively in order or connected at the same time. The specific forms that the bicycle battery holder and the bicycle battery can take are not limited to the forms illustrated in the above-described embodiment. The bicycle battery holder and the bicycle battery can take various forms that are different from the above-described embodiment. The modified example of the above-described embodiment presented below is one example of the various forms that the bicycle battery holder and the bicycle battery can take. It is also possible to change the battery holder 10 to a battery holder 50, as shown in FIGS. 11 and 12. The battery holder 50 comprises a retaining part 52. The retaining part 52 comprises a first portion 54 and a second portion 56. The retaining part 52 holds a side surface 40A, which is a portion of the battery unit 40 that is different from both the first support portion 12 and the second support portion 14. The second portion 56 is provided to be fixed to the first support portion 12. The first portion 54 is coupled to the second portion 56, slidably with respect to the second portion 56. The first portion 54 and the second portion 56 are provided on either sides of the first support portion 12 and the second support portion 14 in the width direction. One end portion 54A of the first portion 54 is attached to the side of the first support portion 12. The other end portion 56A of the second portion 56 is attached to the side of the second support portion 14. For this reason, the retaining part 52 couples the first support portion 12 and the second support portion 14. The retaining part 52 changes in length, along with the changing of the distance between the first support portion 12 and the second support portion 14, when the second support portion 14 moves on the rail 24. It is also possible to change the moving mechanism 16 of the battery holder 10 to a moving mechanism 60, as shown in FIGS. 13 and 14. The moving mechanism 60 comprises a rail 62 and a securing structure 64. A groove 62A is formed on the side of the rail 62 extending along the longitudinal direction of the rail 62. The cross section of the rail 62 has a U-shape. The lower part of the second support portion 14 is fitted into a U-shaped opening 62B. The U-shaped opening 62B is slightly larger than the second support portion 14. The securing structure 64 comprises a lever 68 and a shaft 66 that extends through the second support portion 14 and fits into the groove 62A. The lever 68 is attached to one end of the shaft 66. A stopper 66A with a larger diameter than the shaft 66 is attached on the other end of the shaft 66. In the modified example described above, when the rotational position of the lever 68 is in the fixed position, the stopper 66A presses to sides 14A and 14B of the second support portion 14 via the rail 62. With this, the position of the second support portion 14 with respect to the rail 62 and the frame F is fixed. When the rotational position of the lever 68 is in the release position, a gap is formed between the rail 62 and the sides 14A and 14B of the second support portion 14. With this, the second support portion 14 becomes movable along the groove 62A of the rail 62. It is also possible to change the second support portion 14 of the battery holder 10 to a second supporting portion 70, as shown in FIGS. 14, 15 and 16. The second support portion 70 comprises a holder 72 that can be attached to the frame F. The holder 72 comprises a first holder 72A, which extends from one side 70A of the second support portion 70, and a second holder 72B, which extends from the other side 70A of the second support portion 70. The holder 72 can cover the outer circumference of the frame F. The position of the second support portion 70 with respect to the frame F is fixed by the end portion of the first holder 72A and the end portion of the second holder 72B being fixed with, for instance, a bolt S. When modifying the second supporting position PB, the holder 72 is detached from the frame F, and the second support portion 70 is attached to the desired position on the frame F. It is also possible to change the first support portion 12 of the battery holder 10 to be movable with respect to the frame F. In this case, for example, the first support portion 12 can be disposed on the rail 24, and a moving mechanism 16 similar to the second support portion 14 can be provided. Also, in this case, the second support portion 14 can be fixed to the frame F with, for example, a bolt. It is also possible to omit the guide portion 20B. In this case as well, the first battery 40X or the first battery BT can be attached to the battery holder 10 with the first example of the mounting method for the battery holder 10 described in the embodiment. It is also possible to change the battery unit 40 to a battery unit 80, as shown in FIGS. 17 and 18. The battery unit 80 comprises a second battery SOY, as shown in FIGS. 17 and 18, and a first battery 80X, as shown in FIG. 18. The second battery 80Y comprises a first terminal 44 for connecting to the terminal 22 of the battery holder 10, in one end portion 82. The other end portion 84 of the battery unit 80 comprises a flat shape. A connector 86Y is formed on a side 81Y of the second battery 80Y. Additionally, the first battery 80X does not comprise a terminal at the end portion 88 but, instead, is provided with a connector 86X on a side 81X. A plurality of batteries 80X and 80Y can be electrically connected by connecting an electric wire L to the connectors 86Y of the first battery 80X and the second battery 80Y. It is also possible to configure the battery unit 40 to comprise three or more batteries 40X and 40Y. For example, when configuring the battery unit 40 with one first battery 40X and two second batteries 40Y, one of the second batteries 40Y is connected to the first support portion 12, and the first battery 40X is connected to the second support portion 14. Then, the other of the second batteries 40Y is disposed between one of the second batteries 40Y, which is supported by the first support portion 12 and the first battery 40X, which is supported by the second support portion 14. In this case, the other of the second batteries 40Y amounts to another battery with respect to the one of the second batteries 40Y. It is also possible to support the battery unit 40 using a retaining member. A retaining member 90 shown in FIG. 19 comprises two attaching portions 92 that can be attached to each of the two battery units 40. The two attaching portions 92 are formed on either ends of a plate-shaped retaining member 90. The attaching portion 92 is a flange formed on the retaining member 90. The retaining member 90 covers part of the side 40A of the two battery units 40. One of the two attaching portions supports the end portion 42 of the battery unit 40, which is supported by the first support portion 12. The other of the two attaching portions supports the end portion 46 of the battery unit 40, which is supported by the second support portion 14. According to the retaining member 90, deviating from a state in which the two battery units 40 are coupled is hard. For this reason, the retaining member 90 can stably support the two battery units 40. Additionally, forming a recess or a protrusion on the side of the battery 40 is possible, and configuring the attaching portion 92 into a protrusion or a recess that fits into this hole is possible. In this case, the retaining member 90 can support the three or more batteries 40X and 40Y by comprising three or more protrusions or recesses. It is also possible to form a recess that fits the second support portion 14 into the second fitting portion 46A of the battery unit 40. In this case, the battery unit 40 is supported by the second support portion 14 via the second fitting portion 46A. Also, in this case, the recess 40B of the battery unit 40 can be omitted. It is also possible to form a protrusion on a side 40A of the battery unit 40. In this case, the second support portion 14 has a concave shape that fits into this protrusion. It is also possible to change the battery unit 40 to a battery unit 40 in which the first fitting portion 42A has a convex shape and a second fitting portion 46A has a concave shape. In this case, the opposing surface 20 of the first support portion 12 has a concave shape into which the protrusion of the first fitting portion 42A is fitted. It is also possible to configure a presentation unit on the side 40A of each of the batteries 40X and 40Y to show the remaining amount of the battery unit 40. The presentation unit, for example, is an LED. It is also possible to mount a plurality of second batteries 40Y to a bicycle B, which comprises a battery holder 100 shown in FIG. 20. The lower portion of the frame F of the bicycle B is opened. The battery holder 100 is attached to the lower portion of the frame F via a rotating shaft 102. The upper portion of the battery holder 100 is opened. A space SA where a plurality of batteries can be disposed is formed inside of the battery holder 100. The space SA can, for example, house three second batteries 40Y. For this reason, when housing one or two second batteries 40Y in the battery holder 100, disposing a box for housing tools, etc. in the space SA is possible. Each second battery 40Y is positioned and prevented from moving within the holder 100 by housing the box. At least a part of the battery holder 100 is housed in a space SF formed in the frame F by rotating around the rotating shaft 102. While only selected embodiments have been chosen to illustrate the present invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that various changes and modifications can be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
