    "patent_description": "CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 from Provisional Application Ser. No. 62/125,302, filed Jan. 20, 2015, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD The disclosure provides for a gel extraction device comprising multifunctional and reusable forceps, a removable cutting element, and a sampler component. The disclosure further provides for a freeze/thaw method which can be used to recover biomolecules from agar or agarose gels. BACKGROUND A great effort has been made to structurally characterize agar and agarose in view of the ubiquitous use in molecular biology, microbiology and biotechnology. Studies had revealed that agar is formed by a mixture of at least two fractions, agarose and agaropectin. Agarose, the predominant component of agar, is a linear polymer. It is a disaccharide made up of D-galactose and 3, 6-anhydro-L-galactopyranose. Agaropectin is a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules that occur in lesser amounts, and is made up of alternating units of D-galactose and L-galactose heavily modified with acidic side-groups, such as sulfate and pyruvate. Agar exhibits hysteresis, melting at 85\u00b0 C. (358 K, 185\u00b0 F.) and solidifying from 32-40\u00b0 C. (305-313 K, 90-104\u00b00 F. ). This property lends a suitable balance between easy melting and good gel stability at relatively high temperatures. Since many scientific applications require incubation at temperatures close to human body temperature (37\u00b0 C.), agar is more appropriate than other solidifying agents that melt at this temperature, such as gelatin.

Agarose, however, contains various impurities which may inhibit downstream reactions if not efficiently removed from the DNA, which is a possibly drawback to using the column methods described above. The method of choice depends on the requirement on the purity and the condition of the laboratory. The disclosure provides for a gel extraction device that can be used to cut and transfer gel slices comprising target molecules (e.g., proteins, polynucleotides, etc.) from an electrophoresed gel, or can be used to cut and transfer cell, tissue, callus, bacteria or fungal cultures from agar. Each of the components making up the gel extraction device provide advantages in comparison to similar devices. For example, most devices for gel extraction suffer from the all too common problem of losing the gel slice while trying to transfer the cut slice from the gel to a container. By contrast the device of the disclosure has a sampler component that protects the gel slice from inadvertent. \u2018drops.\u2019 Furthermore, the devices, disclosed herein can be used in many fields beyond molecular biology, for example, the Sampler can be used not only to transfer the target gel, but also to transfer the cultured material from the old medium to a new one, to take samples from agar culture medium to measure nutrient consumed or metabolites produced by cultured living organism. Components making up the gel extraction device are either disposable e.g. the double-edged cutting device, pipet tips and micro-centrifuge tubes or reusable, such as the forceps and the Samplers. The gel extraction device is dimensioned such that it can be easily manipulated using one hand. Moreover, the device can be manipulated in a similar manner as common forceps, whereby the arms of the multifunctional forceps disclosed herein can be manipulated by applying pressure on the arms to press the tips of the arms together or alternatively to spread the tips apart. Therefore, manipulating the arms of the forceps allows for manipulation of the sampler component to open and close. Accordingly, the sampler component can function like a spatula where the sampler can be used scoop up a gel slice and hold it securely with the closed sampler component. The gel extraction device of the disclosure can be comprised of one or more structural features depicted in FIGS. 1-11. FIG. 1 presents an exploded view of forceps 25, sampler 30, cutting element 8, extractor 9 and collector 10 that used for gel or sample cutting and components used for transferring target molecules recovered from the cut agar or/and agarose gel. Forceps 25 is comprised of a right forceps housing 1 and left forceps housing 2, spring 5, and rod 601. Right forceps housing 1 and left forceps housing 2 can be attached to each other using a fastening means. Examples of fastening means, include, but are not limited to, using fasteners (e.g., screws, clips, rivets and the like); using fastening agents (e.g., glues, cements and the like); or welding. In one embodiment, the fastening means is screws 603. Sampler 30 is comprised of right sampler housing 3 and left sampler housing 4. Other structures depicted in FIG. 1, include gel cutting element 8, extractor 9 and collector 10. FIG. 2A presents a close-up view of right sampler housing 3. Hole 201 is dimensioned to receive a small projection 604 from left forceps housing 2 or right forceps housing 1 (e.g., see small projections 604 in FIG. 6.) In particular embodiments, hole 201 is round or oval in shape. In other embodiments, hole 201 is rectangular, square, hexagonal, triangular, or uniquely shaped. Security belt 202 with hole 201 provides an alternative way to secure right sampler housing 3 with left forceps housing 2 or right forceps housing 1. Main joint receptacle 203 of main joint housing 204 is suitably dimensioned to receive a bottom end 605 of forceps 25. Right sampler housing 3 further comprises a lower portion comprised of three panels, right panel 206 and the left panel 207 and the back panel 205. All three panels have same height at the top. The bottom of back panel 205 is shorter than adjoining right panel 206 and the left panel 207, thereby providing a slotted opening which allows bottom panel 305 of left sampler housing 4 in FIG. 3 to slidably pass through back panel 205 according to the gel slice or sample size. Both the right panel 206 and the left panel 207 have an inset groove 208 at the bottom of the panels to receive bottom panel 305 of left sampler housing 4. Inset grove 208 sliedably orients the connection of bottom panel 305 of left sampler housing 4 to right sample housing 3 and further prevents any possible dislocation of the bottom panel 305 from left sampler housing 3 during sample collection. FIG. 23 presents a cut away detailed view of the back panel 205 and the left panel 207 of right sample housing 3 of Sampler 30. As shown, the bottom of back panel 205 is shorter than adjoining left panel 207, thereby providing a slotted opening which allows bottom panel 305 of left sampler housing 4 to slidably pass through back panel 205. Also shown, is a close-up of an inset groove 208 at the bottom of the left panel 207 that is dimensioned to receive the side portion of bottom panel 305 of left sampler housing 4. FIG. 3 provides a close-up view of the structure of left sampler housing 4 of Sampler 30. Hole 301 is dimensioned to receive a small projection 604 from left forceps housing 2 or right forceps housing 1 (e.g., see small projections 604 in FIG. 6.) In particular embodiments, hole 301 is round or oval in shape in other embodiments, hole 301 is rectangular, square, hexagonal, triangular, or uniquely shaped.

Main joint receptacle 303 of main joint housing 304 is suitably dimensioned to receive a bottom end 605 of forceps 25. Left sampler housing 4 further comprises a lower portion comprised of two panels, back panel 305 and bottom panel 306. Back panel 305 is narrower in width than the bottom panel 306, which allows the bottom panel 306 of left sampler housing 4 to slidably insert into inset grooves 208 of right panel 206 and left panel 207 of right sampler housing 3. Possible dislocation of the bottom panel 306 and target gel or sample from damage is prevented by fit between bottom panel 306 and the groove at the bottom of back panel 205 of right sampler housing 3. FIG. 4A provides a top front perspective view of left sampler housing 4 and right sampler housing 3 of sampler 30. Hole 201 and hole 301 are dimensioned to receive a small projection 604 from left forceps housing 2 and right forceps housing 1 to hold both left sampler housing 4 and right sampler housing 3 of sampler 30 with forceps 25. Security belt 202 and security belt 302 comprising hole 201 and hole 301 are an alternative way to secure both left sampler housing 4 and right sampler housing 3 of sampler 30 with forceps 25.

As shown, back panel 305 of the left housing 4 is tightly joins with the right panel 206 of the right sampler housing 3 of the sampler 30. FIG. 5 provides a top front perspective view of the sampler 30 showing an alternative way for the forceps 25 to join with the sampler 30 via threads. Female threads 501 and 502 join with the threated bottom end 605 (not shown). FIG. 6 provides a top front perspective view of the forceps 25. Forceps 25 comprises left forceps housing 2 and right forceps housing 1 which can be joined together by a fastening means, e.g., screws 603 and pin 606. Rod 601 is at the top end of the forceps 25 and can be stretched out manually by pushing forward protrusion 602 and backward automatically when pushing down the protrusion 602. Rod 601 when extended is used to join with gel cutting device 8 as showed in FIG. 1 and FIG. 8. Small projections 604 are used to match with holes 201 and 301 as showed in FIGS. 2 and 3. Bottom ends 605 of forceps 25 are used to insert into the main joint receptacles. 203 and 303 as shown in FIG. 2, FIG. 3, and FIG. 5.

Forceps 25 is comprised of right forceps housing 1, left forceps housing 2, spring 707, and rod 601. Right forceps housing 1 and left forceps housing 2 can be joined together using a fastening means, e.g., screws 603. For example, screws 603 can attach right forceps housing 1 and left forceps housing 2 together by using internal threads 701. Each of right forceps housing 1 and left forceps housing 2 has a longitudinal groove 705 that is each dimensioned to fit a radius of the rod 601 and half portion of spring 707. Rod 601 can be extended by pushing down on spring loaded protrusion 602 and retracted by sliding back spring loaded protrusion 602. Slide groove 702 allows protrusion 602 to slide backwards and/or forwards as needed. Rod 601 and spring 707 are held inside of longitudinal groove 705. Spring 707 comprises two hooks, hook 721 and hook 722, on each end used to hook up with the hoop on the end rod 601 and pin 606. A half way groove 704 can accommodate small protrusion 608. Small protrusion 711 can provide additional support for rod 601 when rod 601 is elongated. Each of small protrusions 604 on each part of the forceps 25 is used to match with hole 201 and hole 301 as showed in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3. Each of bottom ends 605 of forceps 25 is used to insert into the main joint receptacle 203 and main joint receptacle 303 as showed in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3. The shape or structure of the bottom ends 605 of the forceps can be vary as long as the ends fit main joint receptacle 203 and main joint receptacle 303 in FIG. 2, FIG. 3 and FIG. 5. FIG. 8A provides a detailed view of the rod 601. Rod 601 comprises spring loaded protrusion 602 and small protrusion 711. Both spring loaded protrusions 602 and small protrusion 711 are located on a rectangle plate 713. Rectangle plate 713 is connected with rod 601 at the front end. The rectangle plate 713 has elasticity to allow the plate to be pushed down via spring loaded protrusion 602. Hoop 712 is used to hook spring 707. The pushed out rod 601 is used to join with opening 801 of the gel cutting element 8 as showed in FIG. 9. When spring loaded protrusion 602 is pushed down, the elastic force of spring 707 will pull rod 601 back in groove 705. As result of the rod 601 being pulled back by the elastic force of spring 707, the used gel cutting element 8 is also being pulled off from the rod 601. FIG. 8B provides enlarged view of the spring 707 to show hook 721 and hook 722. FIG. 9A provides a front perspective view of cutting element 8. The to part of cutting element 8 comprises opening 801 which is dimensioned to accommodate rod 601.

In particular embodiment, angle 802 can be angle between 90 degrees to 180 degrees, between 100 degrees to 170 degrees, between 110 to 160 degrees, between 120 to 150 degrees, between 130 to 140 degrees, about 120 degrees, about 130 degrees, or about 135 degrees. The central portion 806 of the cutting element housing is of sufficient thickness in order to support the sword and prevent bending due to the unbalanced force. Flat plate 804 at the bottom of cutting element 8 is an alternative way to keep the cutting to be stable and protect the equipment from damage. FIG. 9B provides a sectional view of the double-edged sword 803 surrounded by central part 806. FIG. 10 presents a front perspective view of a pipet tip with corrugated structure 902 on the outside of the tip wall. Opening 901 is dimensioned to fit standard micropipettes, such as those manufactured by various venders known in the art. In certain embodiments, corrugated structure 902 matches with corrugated structure 1001 showed in FIG. 11. Corrugated structure 902 can be used to gently press against a target gel slice to expel biomolecules placed, e.g., a gel slice placed in micro-centrifuge tube 10. FIG. 11 presents a detailed partial cut away view of the corrugated structure 1001 on the inner wall of the micro-centrifuge tube 10. Micro-centrifuge tube 10 is dimensioned so as to fit standard size holders in micro-centrifuges. Also provided, is three dimensional view of a micro-centrifuge tube 10 with corrugated structure 1001 on the inner wail. The corrugated structure matches with corrugated structure 902 on the outside of the tip 9 to gently press the target gel slice to expel liquid comprising biomolecules. The disclosure further provides a process for recovering biomolecules from agar or agarose gels using the freeze/thaw methods disclosed herein. It should be understood that the freeze/thaw methods disclosed herein can be performed using the gel extraction device of the disclosure including components that can be used with said device, such as tip 9 and micro-centrifuge tube 10, or alternatively, the freeze/thaw methods can be performed without using said gel extraction device. The freeze/thaw methods disclosed herein are principled on the basis that water molecules expand to about 9% of their volume when water is converted to ice when exposed to freezing to sub-freezing temperatures, and this volume expansion changes the pore or size of gelled agar and agarose. Agar and agarose comprise three-dimensional matrices formed when helical agar and agarose molecules form supercoiled bundles that organize into three-dimensional structures with channels and pores running through the structures. The 3-D structure is held together with hydrogen bonds and can therefore the organized structure can be disrupted by breaking these hydrogen bonds by heating above a certain temperature. During the freezing process of gels comprising agar or agarose, the original pore size or the molecular mesh of the gels expand by about 9% due to the volume expansion from water being converted to ice. The overall structure agar and agarose, however, remains largely unchanged, in that the agar and agarose gels do not fracture even with the volume expansion. However, the original pore size of the agar and agarose gel are irreparably changed by the volume expansion. In particular, the pore size is permanently enlarged, even with the thawing of the gel. The enlarged pore size, however, allows biomolecules that are trapped with the gel to escape when liquid is expelled from the thawed gels. The freeze/thaw methods disclosed herein allow for the recovery of these biomolecules from thawed gels. Any number of biomolecules can be recovered from the thawed gels, including polynucleotides, such as RNA, DNA, cDNA, and smaller fragments of the foregoing; polypeptides, such as proteins; amino acids; metabolites from bacterial, fungal, plant or eukaryotic cell cultures; etc. Accordingly, the freeze/thaw methods disclosed herein can be used to analyze metabolite production, nutrient consumption, etc. from cultures grown on/in agar, such as bacterial, fungal, eukaryotic cell, protoplast and plant tissue cultures. EXAMPLES Determining suitable temperatures to freeze Agar and Agarose gels. In order to determine which temperature would be suitable for freezing agar and agarose gels, Agar and agarose gels (0.8%-3.5%) were placed at 0\u00b0 C., \u22124\u00b0 C., \u221220\u00b0 C., \u221280\u00b0 C. and \u2212196 \u00b0 C., respectively. The gels froze at \u22124\u00b0 C., \u221220\u00b0 C., \u221280\u00b0 C. and \u2212196\u00b0 C., but not at 0\u00b0 C. The frozen gels when thawed did not disintegrate at room temperature. The buffer contained in the gel slice could be released by gently pressing the gel slice against the wall of a micro-centrifuge tube with a pipette tip. The results demonstrate that as long as the gel is frozen at less than \u22124\u00b0 C., the DNA or any other molecules in the buffer were released from the gel once thawed at ambient temperature. Testing Techniques to expel liquid comprising target molecules from thawed gel. When the concentration of agar or agarose is low, e.g., 0.8% of agar or agarose, the buffer with DNA or other molecules are released automatically when the frozen gel is thawed at ambient temperature or at an elevated temperature, such as 37\u00b0 C. One method to forcibly expel liquid from the gel comprising placing the gel into a 0.6-1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube, freezing and thawing the gel, and pressing the gel against the inner wail of a micro-centrifuge tube using a pipet tip. The second method was to place the micro-centrifuge tube on a vortex, and shake the tube at the lowest settings for a few seconds. The third method tested was to shake the tube in air by hand. All techniques provided a visible eluent. However, for recovery of DNA from a higher concentration of agarose (3.5%), centrifugation was found to be the best choice. Testing whether freezing the gels changed mesh size. In order to find out and further to prove that freezing the gels changed the mesh (pore) size of the agar and agarose gels, different concentrations of agar or agarose were used to recover DNA, RNA, Protein or Bio-extracts from the gels. 0.8% and 3.5% agarose gels were made with TAE buffer, and sliced into 3 sections. One section was frozen at \u221220\u00b0 C. and thawed at room temperature afterwards, another section was kept at 4\u00b0 C. (not frozen). Molecular markers were loaded into the gel section and electrophoresed. Results of the electrophoresis showed that the agarose gel molecular meshes were changed after being frozen, and as result the frozen gel failed to separate DNA samples as compared with the unfrozen gel, i.e., DNA samples loaded on the frozen gel cannot be separated, by contrast, DNA sample and molecular marker were well separated on the regular unfrozen gel (see FIG. 12A-B, and FIG. 13) It was further found that agar or agarose gels have the ability to withstand about 9% volume increase without breaking the molecular meshes, and further that the agar and agarose gel meshes were permanently changed with using a freeze/thaw cycle. By contrast, an unfrozen agarose gel (1%) can be run multiple times (e.g., >5 times) and not show any changes in the mesh size. Recovering agar and agarose gel meshes by melting and reforming gels. DNA did not separate on an agarose gel that was frozen at \u221220\u00b0 C. and thawed at room temperature when electrophoresed. This gel was then melted using a microwave and a new gel was cast. This \u201cnew gel\u201d was loaded with DNA samples and a marker and then ran under the same electrophoresis conditions as described above. The results with the \u201cnew gel\u201d were the same as the unfrozen gel. Accordingly, these results demonstrate that agar and agarose molecular meshes or pore size can only be recovered by melting and re-casting the gels. Recovering and Quantifying DNA recovered from the gels. DNA recovered by using the aforementioned freeze/thaw method was quantified and qualified using a Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer. If the recovered DNA recovered is found to have a too low concentration, the DNA can be precipitated using ethanol (see Table 1). Moreover, precipitating with ethanol also provide higher quality DNA.

Comparing DNA extracted from using freeze/thawed gels versus DNA extracted using a commercial kit. DNA recovered by using the freeze/thaw methods described herein were compared with DNA purified by using an up-dated method and kit (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit\u2122, catalog No. 28706). The DNA samples were run on gels, and gel slices comprising a DNA band were collected. Then gel slices were extracted either by using the freeze/thaw methods disclosed herein, or by using the commercial kit. The recovered DNA were run on an agarose gel to visualize and compare the DNA bands (see FIG. 15A-B). Determining whether DNA purified by methods disclosed herein was suitable in sensitive assays like qPCR. Recovered DNA from frozen gels was used as template for qPCR to test the quality of the DNA. All results showed that the recovered DNA by using the disclosed freeze/thaw method can be used directly for QPCR without any need for further purification. (see FIG. 16, see also Table 2).
