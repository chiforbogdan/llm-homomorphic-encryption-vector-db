    "patent_description": "TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a cooling system and a method for controlling a refrigerant supply volume in the cooling system, and in particular relates to a cooling system to a plurality of heat generation sources and a method for controlling a refrigerant supply volume in the cooling system. BACKGROUND ART A large number of electronic devices are installed in a server rack in a data center. The date center is composed by allocating a large number of such server racks. In a general data center, an air conditioner is used, the room temperature is lowered by supplying a cooling wind, and thereby the large number of electronic devices which generate heat in operation are cooled. However, in recent years, an amount of heat generated by the electronic device increases and the electronic device is highly integrated, and thereby the power consumption of the air conditioner increases. The amount of heat generated by the electronic device is different from each electronic device because a type or an operation rate thereof is different from each other, and thereby a point called as \u201ca hot spot\u201d at which the local temperature is higher than the surrounding area is generated. In order to deal with the hot spot, when the air conditioner is used for further lowering the room temperature, a large amount of electric power is required for operating the air conditioner. It is known such a method in which a cooler is placed in the vicinity of the heat generation source for cooling, without using the air conditioner to cool the entire of installed environment. Patent Literature 1 (PTL1) proposes a method in which a refrigerant for cooling is circulated from a shared cooling tower to a plurality of servers installed in a server room placed on a plurality of floors, and thereby the electronic device in the server installed in the server room is cooled. FIG. 10 is a configuration diagram showing a main part extracted from a drawing in Patent Literature 1 (PTL1). The relevant cooling system disclosed in Patent Literature 1 (PTL1) is used for cooling the electronic devices installed in a server room 301 and a server room 302 that are placed on a first floor and a second floor of a two-story building 300, respectively. A plurality of servers 303 are installed on a floor surface 301a of the server room 301 and a floor surface 302a of the server room 302. Evaporators 304 are arranged near the servers 303, respectively. A temperature sensor 312b for detecting the temperature around it and a valve 313b inserted in a pipe laid near each evaporator 304 are provided for each evaporator 304. A cooling tower 307 is placed on the roof of the building 300. In Patent Literature 1 (PTL1), a refrigerant is sent to the evaporator 304 on each floor from the cooling tower 307 through a supply pipe 305. The refrigerant flowing in a cooling coil inside the evaporator 304 is evaporated by high-temperature air generated by the server 303, and thereby the vaporization heat is taken from the surrounding air and the refrigerant gasifies. As a result, the server 303 itself and the high-temperature air discharged from the server 303 are cooled. The refrigerant gasified by each evaporator 304 is sent to the cooling tower 307 through a return pipe 306. In the cooling tower 307, the gasified refrigerant is cooled by water or air, condensed, and liquefied. In Patent Literature 1 (PTL1), a heat exchanger 308 is further connected to the supply pipe 305 and the return pipe 306 in parallel to the cooling tower 307. Another cooling tower 310 is connected to the heat exchanger 308 via a refrigerating machine 309. The temperature is detected by a temperature sensor 312a provided midway in the pipe of the cooling tower 307 and the pipe of the heat exchanger 308 and a plurality of valves 313a arranged midway in the pipe are controlled by a control unit 311 according to a detected result. By adjusting an opening amount of the valve 313a, a volume of the refrigerant to be flowed in the heat exchanger 308 is controlled. Further, the temperature near each evaporator 304 is detected by the temperature sensor 312b and the valve 313b of the pipe of each evaporator 304 is controlled according to a detected result. In Patent Literature 1 (PTL1), the cooling tower 307 and the heat exchanger 308 are placed on the roof of the building 300 and the refrigerant from the cooling tower 307 and the heat exchanger 308 is sent in the building 300, in other words, it is sent to the evaporator 304 located at a position lower than that of the cooling tower 307 or the heat exchanger 308. The refrigerant is naturally circulated between the evaporator 304 and the cooling tower 307, and thereby the cooling is performed. Patent Literature 2 (PTL2) relates to an air-conditioning system, and proposes a phase-change cooler which transports heat by using latent heat required when phase change of refrigerant occurs. The phase-change cooler in Patent Literature 2 (PTL2) includes an evaporation unit which receives heat from a heat generator and changes the phase of the refrigerant from a liquid phase to a gas phase and a condensation unit which takes the heat of the gas-phase refrigerant by an external fan or the like and changes the phase of the refrigerant from the gas phase to the liquid phase. The phase-change cooler in Patent Literature 2 (PTL2) further includes a pipe which connects the evaporation unit and the condensation unit, and the refrigerant which is circulated in the pipe in a completely closed state. Patent Literature 3 (PTL3) relates to an ebullient cooling type cooling device. Patent Literature 3 (PTL3) describes that heat generated by a power conversion device that is an object to be cooled is sent to a boiling container, in the boiling container, the refrigerant in a liquid state is changed to a vapor by the heat generated by the power conversion device, and the heat generated by the latent heat is absorbed. Further, it is described that the heat of the gas-phase refrigerant generated in the boiling container is lost by a heat exchange operation, the refrigerant is condensed and liquefied, the generated liquid flows in a sloping heat-transfer tube and the liquid-phase refrigerant is generated, and the liquid-phase refrigerant goes back to the boiling container. It is described that a cycle in which the refrigerant evaporates in the boiling container and condenses in the heat-transfer tube is repeated, and thereby the heat generated by the power conversion device is discharged. CITATION LIST Patent Literature [PTL 1] Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2009-194093 [PTL 2] Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2007-127315 [PTL 3] Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2012-54316 SUMMARY OF INVENTION Technical Problem However, the cooling system, the air-conditioning system, and the cooling device described in the background art have the following problem. First, the amount of heat generated by the electronic device is different from each electronic device because a type or an operation rate thereof is different from each other, and thereby the amount of heat generated by a server rack unit is different for each server rack unit. In a case that when cooling is performed by transporting heat using circulation of refrigerant having phase-change characteristic, cooling efficiency is lowered if shortage of the refrigerant occurs. In a case in which the phase of the refrigerant is changed, the refrigerant is circulated, the heat is transported, and cooling is performed, when a shortage of the refrigerant occurs, cooling efficiency is reduced. Further, when the refrigerant is excessively supplied, the cooling efficiency is also lowered because of the increase of the boiling point with the increase of an internal pressure or the like. As described above, when the phase-change cooler is used, it becomes important to supply an optimum volume of refrigerant that matches with the generated heat amount. In order to optimize the refrigerant supply volume, a complicated control mechanism is needed as in Patent Literature 1 such that a temperature sensor and a valve are provided for each evaporator and the refrigerant supply volume is controlled. Secondly, even when the refrigerant supply volume is controlled for each server rack unit in response to variation in amount of heat generated by the server rack unit, the control mechanism as in Patent Literature 1 cannot deal with variation in amount of heat generated by unit of the electronic device (or for each height) installed in the server rack. For this reason, optimized cooling cannot be performed, and thereby a hot spot may occur. Such problem cannot be solved even by using the air-conditioning system in Patent Literature 2 or the cooling device in Patent Literature 3. In Patent Literature 3, only one boiling container is used in a closed system in which the refrigerant is circulated. Therefore, Patent Literature 3 does not show such a structure that a plurality of boiling containers are equipped in the closed system and in which an optimum volume of the refrigerant is supplied to each boiling container. It is an object of the present invention to provide a cooling system which can solve the above-mentioned problem in which a control mechanism becomes complex when an optimum volume of refrigerant is stably supplied to a plurality of objects to be cooled that have differing heat generation values and a method for controlling refrigerant supply volume in the cooling system. Solution to Problem In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, a cooling system according to the present invention includes a first refrigerant tank which stores a liquid-phase refrigerant, a plurality of evaporation units which gasify the liquid-phase refrigerant supplied from the first refrigerant tank, a condensation unit which liquefies a gas-phase refrigerant gasified by the evaporation unit, a vapor pipe which connects the evaporation unit and the condensation unit and in which the gas-phase refrigerant flows, and a liquid pipe which connects the condensation unit and the first refrigerant tank and connects the first refrigerant tank and a plurality of the evaporation units and in which the liquid-phase refrigerant flows. The condensation unit is arranged at a position higher than those of a plurality of the evaporation units and the first refrigerant tank is arranged at a position lower than that of the condensation unit. A method for controlling a refrigerant supply volume in a cooling system according to the present invention includes a step of controlling a volume of liquid-phase refrigerant supplied to an evaporation unit by changing an arrangement of a refrigerant tank in a vertical direction in the cooling system which includes a refrigerant tank which stores the liquid-phase refrigerant, a plurality of evaporation units which gasify the liquid-phase refrigerant supplied from the refrigerant tank, a condensation unit which liquefies a gas-phase refrigerant gasified by the evaporation unit, a vapor pipe which connects the evaporation unit and the condensation unit and in which the gas-phase refrigerant flows, and a liquid pipe which connects the condensation unit and the refrigerant tank and connects the refrigerant tank and a plurality of the evaporation units and in which the liquid-phase refrigerant flows. Advantageous Effects of Invention By using a cooling system and a method for controlling refrigerant supply volume in a cooling system according to the present invention, an optimum volume of refrigerant can be stably supplied to a plurality of objects to be cooled, each of which has a different heat generation amount from each other, without using a complicated control mechanism.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS A preferred exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to drawings. In the following explanation, a case in which a plurality of server racks in which an electronic device is installed are cooled will be explained as an example. First Exemplary Embodiment First, a cooling system according to a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention and a method for controlling refrigerant supply volume in the cooling system will be described. FIG. 1 is a configuration diagram showing the cooling system according to the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 1, the cooling system according to this exemplary embodiment includes a refrigerant tank 103 provided as an example of a first refrigerant tank which stores a liquid-phase refrigerant 106 and a plurality of evaporation units 101 which gasify the liquid-phase refrigerant supplied from the refrigerant tank 103. Further, the cooling system according to this exemplary embodiment includes a condensation unit 102 which liquefies a gas-phase refrigerant gasified by a plurality of the evaporation units 101, and a vapor pipe 105 which connects the evaporation unit 101 and the condensation unit 102 and in which the gas-phase refrigerant flows. Further, the cooling system according to this exemplary embodiment includes a liquid pipe 104 which connects the condensation unit 102 and the refrigerant tank 103 and connects the refrigerant tank 103 and a plurality of the evaporation units 101 and in which the liquid-phase refrigerant flows. Here, the condensation unit 102 is arranged at a position higher than those of a plurality of the evaporation units 101 in a vertical upper direction as an example of the upper side, and the refrigerant tank 103 is arranged at a position lower than that of the condensation unit 102 in a vertical lower direction as an example of the lower side. The refrigerant tank 103 is arranged at a position higher than those of a plurality of the evaporation units 101 when viewed from an installation surface 100a of a plurality of server racks 100. A heat exchange machine such as a radiator or the like can be used as a plurality of the evaporation units 101 and the condensation unit 102. A plurality of the evaporation units 101 are arranged on the rear surface or the front surface of the server rack 100. FIG. 1 shows a case in which two server racks 100 whose outer shapes are vertically long are installed and one evaporation unit 101 whose outer shape is vertically long is arranged for each server rack 100. The electronic device that is a heat generation source is installed in the server rack 100. Each evaporation unit 101 is a heat receiving unit which receives heat of the high-temperature air generated by the heat generation source. The liquid pipe 104 connects a lower part of the condensation unit 102 and an upper part of the refrigerant tank 103, and connects a lower part of the side surface of the refrigerant tank 103 and a lower part of each evaporation unit 101. The vapor pipe 105 connects an upper part of each evaporation unit 101 and an upper part of the condensation unit 102. The refrigerant 106 is enclosed in such closed system. In the cooling system according to this exemplary embodiment, the liquid-phase refrigerant is supplied to each evaporation unit 101 by the gravity naturally. The level of liquid in each evaporation unit 101 is determined by the level of liquid in the refrigerant tank 103, and does not depend on an amount of heat generated by the electronic device installed in each server rack 100. FIG. 1 shows a state in which all the evaporation units 101 are always filled with the refrigerant. In the cooling system according to this exemplary embodiment, a volume of refrigerant supplied to each evaporation unit 101 can be uniformly controlled by controlling the level of liquid in the refrigerant tank 103, and the controlling the level of liquid in the refrigerant tank 103 is performed by changing the installation position of the refrigerant tank 103 along the vertical direction. Further, in FIG. 1, each liquid pipe 104 and the vapor pipe 105 are drawn as lines extending in the vertical direction or the horizontal direction. However, it is not necessary to place each liquid pipe 104 and the vapor pipe 105 in a completely vertical direction or a completely horizontal direction. Second Exemplary Embodiment Next, a cooling system according to a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention and a method for controlling a refrigerant supply volume in the cooling system will be described. FIG. 2 is a configuration diagram showing the cooling system according to the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The same reference numbers are added to elements similar to the first exemplary embodiment, and thereby the detailed description of the element will be omitted. This exemplary embodiment is a modification example of the first exemplary embodiment. In this exemplary embodiment, a second refrigerant tank is provided for each evaporation unit. As shown in FIG. 2, the cooling system according to this exemplary embodiment includes the refrigerant tank 103 provided as an example of the first refrigerant tank which stores the liquid-phase refrigerant 106 and a plurality of evaporation units 101 which gasify the liquid-phase refrigerant supplied from the refrigerant tank 103 like the first exemplary embodiment.

Further, the cooling system according to this exemplary embodiment includes the liquid pipe 104 which sends the liquid-phase refrigerant to the refrigerant tank 103 and sends the liquid-phase refrigerant to a plurality of the evaporation units 101 from the refrigerant tank 103. The condensation unit 102 is arranged at a position higher than those of a plurality of the evaporation units 101 in the vertical upper direction as an example of the upper side, and the refrigerant tank 103 is arranged at a position lower than that of the condensation unit 102 in the vertical lower direction as an example of the lower side like the first exemplary embodiment. The cooling system according to this exemplary embodiment further includes second refrigerant tanks 107, a refrigerant recovery pipe 109, a pump 108, and liquid pipes 104a and 104b. The second refrigerant tank 107 is provided to the pipe 104 connecting the refrigerant tank 103 and each evaporation unit 101 and arranged at a position lower than that of the refrigerant tank 103 in the vertical lower direction as an example of the lower side. In other words, in this exemplary embodiment, the second refrigerant tank 107 is provided for each server rack 100. As a result, the refrigerant 106 is supplied to each evaporation unit 101 via the second refrigerant tank 107. The liquid pipe 104a is branched off from the liquid pipe 104 near the midpoint of the side surface of each second refrigerant tank 107, and the liquid pipe 104a is connected to the refrigerant recovery pipe 109 arranged in a space under an installation surface 100a of the server rack 100, for example, an underfloor space or the like. The refrigerant recovery pipe 109 is connected to the refrigerant tank 103 via the liquid pipe 104b, and the pump 108 is arranged between the refrigerant recovery pipe 109 and the liquid pipe 104b. In the cooling system according to this exemplary embodiment, a part of the refrigerant 106 in the second refrigerant tank 107 is discharged from near the midpoint of the side surface of the second refrigerant tank 107 to the refrigerant recovery pipe 109 through the liquid pipe 104a. The refrigerant discharged to the refrigerant recovery pipe 109 is returned to the refrigerant tank 103 via the liquid pipe 104b by an operation of the pump 108. Namely, the refrigerant discharged to the refrigerant recovery pipe 109 is pumped up by the pump 108 and returned to the refrigerant tank 103. Further, in a case in which a data center is of plural-story construction and there is a server room in the downstairs floor, the pump 108 is not used and the refrigerant discharged to the refrigerant recovery pipe 109 may be sent to the refrigerant tank in the downstairs server room. The refrigerant recovery pipe 109 is extended also toward a left direction in paper of FIG. 2. In a case in which there is a server room in the downstairs floor, the refrigerant recovery pipe 109 extending toward the left direction in paper of FIG. 2 may be connected to the refrigerant tank in the downstairs server room. In the cooling system according to this exemplary embodiment, the liquid-phase refrigerant is supplied to each evaporation unit 101 by the gravity naturally like the first exemplary embodiment. The level of liquid in each evaporation unit 101 is determined by the level of liquid in the second refrigerant tank 107, and does not depend on an amount of heat generated by the electronic device installed in each server rack 100. In this exemplary embodiment, the volume of refrigerant supplied to the evaporation unit 101 can be optimized by controlling the level of liquid in the second refrigerant tank 107, and the controlling the level of liquid in the second refrigerant tank 107 is performed by changing the installation position of the second refrigerant tank 107 along the vertical direction. Further, in the cooling system according to this exemplary embodiment, the surplus refrigerant 106 in the second refrigerant tank 107 is discharged to the refrigerant recovery pipe 109 through the branched liquid pipe 104a. As a result, the level of liquid in the second refrigerant tank 107 is kept to a constant level that is equal to a height of a branching point. As a result, the volume of refrigerant supplied to a plurality of the evaporation units 101 becomes more stable. In the first exemplary embodiment, the volume of refrigerant supplied to each evaporation unit 101 is controlled on the basis of the level of liquid in the refrigerant tank 103. However, when this exemplary embodiment is used, the volume of refrigerant supplied to each evaporation unit 101 can be controlled on the basis of the level of liquid in the second refrigerant tank 107. As a result, the volume of refrigerant supplied to each evaporation unit 101 can be optimized. Third Exemplary Embodiment Next, a cooling system according to a third exemplary embodiment of the present invention and a method for controlling a refrigerant supply volume in the cooling system will be described.

The cooling system according to this exemplary embodiment further includes a refrigerant control mechanism, which controls the refrigerant supply volume according to the level of liquid in the second refrigerant tank 107, provided between the refrigerant tank 103 and a plurality of the second refrigerant tanks 107. Specifically, the refrigerant control mechanism is a refrigerant supply volume suppression mechanism 111 which suppresses the refrigerant supply volume according to the level of liquid in the second refrigerant tank 107. As this refrigerant supply volume suppression mechanism 111, a float valve, a ball tap or the like can be used. The refrigerant 106 is supplied to each evaporation unit 101 from the refrigerant tank 103 via the second refrigerant tank 107. In the cooling system according to this exemplary embodiment, the liquid-phase refrigerant is supplied to each evaporation unit 101 by the gravity naturally like the first exemplary embodiment or the second exemplary embodiment. The level of liquid in each evaporation unit 101 is determined by the level of liquid in the second refrigerant tank 107, and does not depend on an amount of heat generated by the electronic device installed in each server rack 100 like the second exemplary embodiment.

Further, in this exemplary embodiment, the refrigerant supply volume suppression mechanism 111 monitors the level of liquid in the second refrigerant tank 107 and when the level of liquid is higher than a predetermined level, the refrigerant supply volume suppression mechanism 111 suppresses the volume of refrigerant supplied to the second refrigerant tank 107. By using this refrigerant supply volume suppression mechanism 111, it becomes possible to control the level of liquid in the second refrigerant tank 107, and thereby the volume of refrigerant supplied to each evaporation unit 101 becomes more stable.
