    "patent_description": "TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent for an ophthalmic disease caused by ocular angiogenesis, which contains a morpholine compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient. BACKGROUND ART Angiogenesis is known to exert a large influence on the wound therapy and progress of many diseases. As ophthalmic diseases involving angiogenesis, retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, neovascular glaucoma and the like are known. In addition, corneal neovascularization due to various stimulations on and invasions into the cornea is also known. In these diseases, angiogenesis lacking a control mechanism occurs. Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) are involved in angiogenesis, and anti-VEGF antibodies such as bevacizumab as well as sorafenib, sunitinib, pegaptanib sodium, ranibizumab, aflibercept, and VEGF-Trap EYE and the like are known as anti-VEGF drugs. Medicaments targeting VEGF are widely used clinically for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, branch retinal vein occlusion, central retinal vein occlusion, diabetic maculopathy, diabetic retinopathy, and neovascular glaucoma and the like. However, since the aforementioned anti-VEGF drugs are administered by intravitreal injection to reduce systemic side effects, a heavy burden is imposed on the patients, and the lens and retinal tissues are constantly exposed to the risk of ocular tissue damage during injection, and bacterial infection. VEGF has various activities such as maintenance of normal choroidal blood vessel homeostasis (e.g., non-patent document 1: Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 2009, 106: 18751-18756), action as a nutritional factor of retinal nerve cells (e.g., non-patent document 2: Am. J. Patho., 2007, 171: 53-67) and the like, and the possibility that a long-term inhibition of VEGF may provide an adverse influence on the ocular tissues cannot be denied. Therefore, the development of a treatment method targeting a molecule other than VEGF and selectively effective for angiogenesis is one of the problems. In recent years, it is known that chemokine, which is one of the cell chemotactic factors, induces angiogenesis (non-patent document 3: Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., 2008, 28: 1928-1936). Particularly, CCL11 in the CC chemokine family is known to induce migration of vascular endothelial cells and angiogenesis in vivo model, by a signal via CCR3, which is a receptor thereof (non-patent document 4: J. Immunology, 2001, 166: 7571-7578). CCR3 is known as a chemokine receptor of eosinophils, and antagonists thereof have been studied as treatment targets of allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis (non-patent document 5: Medicinal Research Reviews, 2010, 30: 778-817). However, it has been clarified that CCR3 is specifically expressed in vascular endothelial cells of choroidal new blood vessels with age-related macular degeneration, and involved in the progress thereof (non-patent document 6: Nature, 2009, 460: 225-230). In addition, a patent application describing that 4-[[[[[[(2S)-4-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)methyl]-2-morpholinyl]methyl]-amino]carbonyl]amino]methyl]benzamide, which is a CCR3 antagonist, is useful for neovascular age related macular degeneration has been published (patent document 1: WO 2013/079696). In addition, it has been reported that expression of CCR3 is found in choroidal vascular endothelial cells in choroidal neovascularization found in eye histoplasmosis syndrome (non-patent document 7: Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci., 2010, 51: E-Abstract 3351), and expression of CCR3 is found in the corneal neovascularization site of a corneal neovascularization model due to corneal injury (non-patent document 8: Int. J. Ophthalmol., 2012, 5: 251-257). Furthermore, it has been recently reported that CCR3 is expressed in the vascular endothelium of a proliferative membrane isolated from proliferative diabetic retinopathy (non-patent document 9: Japanese Journal of Ophthalmology 2013 vol. 117, Extra issue, Abstract No. P-140). Therefore, a low-molecular-weight compound showing a CCR3 antagonistic action can treat and/or prevent ocular angiogenesis by a mechanism different from that of an anti-VEGF drug.

EXAMPLES While the present invention is explained in detail in the following by referring to Synthetic Examples and Experimental Examples, the present invention is not limited by the examples in any way. Synthetic Example 1 Synthesis of (2S)\u2014N-{[4-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)morpholin-2-yl]methyl}chloroacetamide 2-{[(2R)-4-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)morpholin-2-yl]methyl}-1H-isoindole-1,3-(2H)-dione (20.76 kg) was dissolved in 158.4 kg of ethanol, 4.82 kg of hydrazine was added dropwise over 6 min, whereby (2S)-2-aminomethyl-4-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)morpholine was obtained. To said (2S)-2-aminomethyl-4-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)morpholine was added 108 kg of toluene, and the mixture was concentrated to the total amount of 60 L, and 246.2 kg of ethanol was added. Thereto was added dropwise a solution of 4.62 kg of oxalic acid in 32.8 kg of ethanol over 1 hr 8 min to give 15.14 kg of (2S)-2-aminomethyl-4-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)morpholine oxalate. (2S)-2-aminomethyl-4-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)morpholine oxalate (14.70 kg) was dissolved in 38.0 kg of t-butylmethylether and 36.8 kg of water. Thereto was added dropwise 19.96 kg of 8N aqueous potassium hydroxide solution over 20 min. After separation of the reaction mixture into an organic layer and an aqueous layer, the aqueous layer was discarded. To the resulting organic layer were added 44.2 kg of water, and 4.40 kg of sodium hydrogen carbonate, 5.46 kg of chloroacetyl chloride was added dropwise over 22 min to give a solution of (2S)\u2014N-{[4-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)morpholin-2-yl]methyl}chloroacetamide in t-butylmethyl ether. Synthetic Example 2 Synthesis of (2S)-[4-(carboxymethyl)thiazol-2-ylthio]-N-{[4-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)morpholin-2-yl]methyl}acetamide hydrobromide 4-Ethoxycarbonylmethyl-2-mercaptothiazole (8.18 kg) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of 22.80 kg of t-butanol and 25.72 kg of water, 13.2 kg of 8N sodium hydroxide was added dropwise over 15 min, and the mixture was stirred for 1 hr. Thereto was added the total amount of the solution of (2S)\u2014N-{[4-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)morpholin-2-yl]methyl}chloroacetamide in t-butylmethyl ether obtained in the above-mentioned Synthetic Example 1, whereby (2S)-[4-(carboxymethyl)thiazol-2-ylthio]-N-{[4-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)morpholin-2-yl]methyl}acetamide was obtained. To said (2S)-[4-(carboxymethyl)thiazol-2-ylthio]-N-{[4-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)morpholin-2-yl]methyl}acetamide was added 68.4 kg of t-butanol, and the mixture was concentrated to the total amount of 44 L, and 81.0 kg of acetonitrile was added thereto. Thereto was added dropwise 6.8 kg of hydrobromic acid over 33 min, and the mixture was stirred and 7.35 kg of t-butanol was added over 5 min. In 15 min from the addition, precipitation of the crystal of (2S)-[4-(carboxymethyl)thiazol-2-ylthio]-N-{[4-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)morpholin-2-yl]methyl}acetamide hydrobromide began, whereby 17.16 kg of the crystals were finally recovered. Experimental Example 1 Treatment Effect Relating to Angiogenesis Using a mouse model experimentally induced to show choroidal neovascularization (hereinafter to be referred to as \u201cCNV\u201d) by laser irradiation (CNV model), efficacy relative to the CNV area was evaluated. The CNV model shows migration of macrophage by induction of inflammation by laser irradiation. As a result, VEGF is produced, and a new blood vessel is developed. Therefore, the CNV model is an experimental model showing the efficacy on a disease associated with ocular angiogenesis via VEGF. Using (2S)-[4-(carboxymethyl)thiazol-2-ylthio]-N-{[4-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)morpholin-2-yl]methyl}acetamide hydrobromide as a test compound, the following experiment was performed. (Method) Laser was irradiated (6 spot irradiation) on one eye of male C57BL/6J mouse (7-week-old) to experimentally induce CNV. The mouse was intramuscularly administered (1 mL/kg) with a ketamine hydrochloride/xylazine hydrochloride (1:1, v/v) mixed solution into the thigh and, after systemic anesthesia, mydriasis was induced with mydriatic eye drops, and laser irradiation (wavelength 532 nm, spot size 50 \u03bcm, irradiation time 0.1 second, laser output 120 mW) was performed at 6 points while avoiding thick capillary in the retina. A control antibody and an anti-mouse VEGF antibody (purchased from R&D Systems, Inc.) were intravitreally (2 L/eye) administered only once immediately after laser irradiation. Based on the most recent body weight, a prepared test liquid of the test compound was orally administered using a sonde at 0.1 mL/10 g (medium: 0.5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose). After confirmation of sufficient recovery from the anesthesia of the test animal after laser irradiation, the test liquid was orally administered once per day only on the laser-induction day, and repeatedly administered orally twice per day from the next day of laser irradiation to one day before the final day. The number of cases was 14 animals/group and, as described in Table 1, not less than 10 cases in number were secured per group. TABLE 1 number of group administra- administra- cases No. group name tion method tion dose (mice) 1 control intravitreal 20 ng/eye 11 antibody 2 anti-mouse VEGF intravitreal 20 ng/eye 13 antibody 3 medium oral \u2014 12 4 test compound oral 20 mg/kg 12 At 7 days from the laser irradiation, under systemic anesthesia by intramuscular administration (1 mL/kg) of a ketamine hydrochloride/xylazine hydrochloride (1:1, v/v) mixed solution into the thigh, a 4% FITC-dextran solution was administered at 0.5 mL/animal from the tail vein. After euthanasia, the eyeball was removed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-phosphate buffer, and flat mount specimen were prepare according to a conventional method. Using a confocal microscope (OLYMPUS FV-1000D; magnification: \u00d720, number of pixels: 512 pixel\u00d7512 pixel), CNV site in a flat mount specimen was photographed, and measured using an image analysis software (NIH ImageJ). The area is expressed in pixel. As the statistical method for each group, t-test was performed between the first group and the second group, and the third group and the fourth group, by using each individual value, and a significant level of each side was set to p<0.05. (Results) The CNV area after 7 days from laser irradiation is shown in FIG. 1. A significant CNV suppressive action was found in the anti-mouse VEGF antibody intravitreal administration group, as compared to the control antibody intravitreal administration group. In the test compound oral administration group, a significant CNV suppressive effect was observed as compared to the only vehicle oral administration group. From these results, since anti-mouse VEGF antibody was significantly suppressed in CNV experimentally induced by laser irradiation, involvement of VEGF was shown. Also, since the test compound showed a significant suppressive effect on CNV of this model by repeated oral administration, a morpholine compound represented by the test compound was shown to inhibit CNV. Experimental Example 2 Inhibitory Effect on Migration of Human Vascular Endothelial Cells Using (2S)-[4-(carboxymethyl)thiazol-2-ylthio]-N-{[4-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)morpholin-2-yl]methyl}acetamide hydrobromide as a test compound, an inhibitory effect on the migration of human vascular endothelial cells, which is induced by a ligand of human CCR3 (e.g., human CCL11, human CCL24, human CCL26 and the like), is evaluated. It is considered that migration of vascular endothelial cells occurs in the process of development of angiogenesis, and a compound that inhibits migration of vascular endothelial cells is considered to be useful as a therapeutic agent for a disease caused by angiogenesis, for example, an ophthalmic disease caused by ocular angiogenesis. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY Since the compound of the present invention suppresses ocular angiogenesis, it is considered to be useful as a therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent for an ophthalmic disease caused by ocular angiogenesis, specifically retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, corneal neovascularization, macular degeneration, neovascular glaucoma, choroidal neovascularization, neovascular maculopathy, branch retinal vein occlusion, central retinal vein occlusion, diabetic maculopathy and the like.
