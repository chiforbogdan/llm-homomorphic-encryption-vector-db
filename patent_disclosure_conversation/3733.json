    "patent_mail": "Subject: Confidential Patent Information - Pixel Structure for Liquid Crystal Displays\n\nDear [Colleague's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to share some essential details regarding a recent patent we have developed related to liquid crystal display technology. Please note that this information is confidential and intended solely for your understanding and collaboration.\n\nThe patent focuses on a novel pixel structure designed to enhance the display performance of liquid crystal panels. Below are the key claims of the patent:\n\n1. **Pixel Structure Configuration**: The pixel structure consists of multiple pixel units arranged in an array. Each pixel unit features a horizontal and vertical dark line that intersect to form a crisscross shape, along with various other dark lines that extend from these intersections.\n\n2. **Dark Line Arrangement**: The pixel units include main and sub pixel units, with specific arrangements of dark lines that facilitate improved optical alignment during the manufacturing process. The black matrices, data lines, common electrodes, and gate lines are arranged to optimize the opening rate of the pixel structure.\n\n3. **Light Spacers**: The design also incorporates light spacers positioned between the pixel units to further enhance performance.\n\n4. **Liquid Crystal Panel Integration**: The pixel structure is intended for use in a liquid crystal panel, which includes an array substrate, an opposite substrate, and a liquid crystal layer. This setup aims to improve the display effect significantly, particularly in COA (Color filter on Array) type panels.\n\nI would like to acknowledge my co-authors on this patent, who have contributed significantly to its development:\n\n- **John Doe** (Employee ID: 1000)\n- **Michael Snow** (Employee ID: 2000)\n- **Summer Winter** (Employee ID: 3000)\n\nPlease treat this information with utmost confidentiality, as it is crucial to our competitive advantage in the market. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position]  \n[Your Company]  \n[Your Contact Information]  "
