    "patent_summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>Bone is composed of organic and inorganic elements. By weight, bone is approximately 20% water. The weight of dry bone is made up of inorganic minerals such as calcium phosphate (e.g. about 65-70% of the weight) and an organic matrix of fibrous protein and collagen (e.g. about 30-35% of the weight). Both mineralized and demineralized bone can be used for grafting purposes. Embodiments of the present invention encompass bone graft compositions containing mixtures of mineralized and demineralized bone, such that the compositions provide a bone allograft material having consistent calcium content, certain mechanical properties and handling characteristics, and desired biological activities. In one aspect, embodiments of the present invention encompass composite bone graft materials, and methods for their use and manufacture. An exemplary method of manufacturing a composite bone graft material for administration to a treatment site of a human patient may include selecting a target calcium content or handling characteristic of the bone graft material, selecting a first amount of mineralized (i.e., non-demineralized) donor bone material, selecting a second amount of demineralized donor bone material, and combining the first and second amounts of bone material so as to obtain a bone graft composition having the target calcium content or handling characteristic. In these or other embodiments, the first amount of mineralized donor bone material may be selected based on the target calcium content or handling characteristic. Relatedly, the second amount of demineralized donor bone material may be selected based on the target calcium content or handling characteristic. In some instances, a ratio of the first amount of mineralized donor bone material to the second amount of demineralized donor bone material may be selected based on the target calcium content or handling characteristic. In some embodiments, the donor is an allogeneic cadaveric donor. In some embodiments, the composite bone graft material includes tissue obtained from the patient. In some embodiments, methods may also include combining adult mesenchymal stem cells with the bone material. In another aspect, embodiments of the present invention may include a bone graft composition. The bone graft composition may include a first amount of non-demineralized cancellous bone, a second amount of demineralized cancellous bone, and a third amount of demineralized cortical bone. The non-demineralized cancellous bone, the demineralized cancellous bone, and the demineralized cortical bone may be obtained from the same cadaveric donor. Non-demineralized bone may be bone that has not contacted any acid and/or has not undergone either a complete or an incomplete demineralization process. In some embodiments, the first amount of non-demineralized cancellous bone may have particles with sizes selected based on needs of the patient, needs of the physician, or for other reasons.

    "patent_description": "CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/200,353 filed Mar. 7, 2014, which is a non-provisional of and claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/774,036 filed Mar. 7, 2013, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Embodiments of the present invention are directed in general to the field of medical grafts, and in particular to bone graft compositions, and methods of their use and manufacture. Medical grafting procedures often involve the implantation of autogenous, allograft, or synthetic grafts into a patient to treat a particular condition or disease. The use of musculoskeletal allograft tissue in reconstructive orthopedic procedures and other medical procedures has markedly increased in recent years, and millions of musculoskeletal allografts have been safely transplanted. A common allograft is bone. Typically, bone grafts are reabsorbed and replaced with the patient's natural bone upon healing. Bone grafts can be used in a variety of indications, including neurosurgical and orthopedic spine procedures for example. In some instances, bone grafts can be used to fuse joints or to repair broken bones. Allograft and autogenous bone are both derived from humans; the difference is that allograft is harvested from an individual (e.g. donor) other than the one (e.g. patient) receiving the graft. Allograft bone is often taken from cadavers that have donated their bone so that it can be used for living people who are in need of it, for example, patients whose bones have degenerated from cancer. Such tissues represent a gift from the donor or the donor family to enhance the quality of life for other people. Hence, bone graft compositions and methods are presently available and provide real benefits to patients in need thereof. Yet many advances may still be made to provide improved bone graft systems and methods for treating patients. The bone graft systems and treatment and manufacture methods described herein provide further solutions and answers to these outstanding needs. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Bone is composed of organic and inorganic elements. By weight, bone is approximately 20% water. The weight of dry bone is made up of inorganic minerals such as calcium phosphate (e.g. about 65-70% of the weight) and an organic matrix of fibrous protein and collagen (e.g. about 30-35% of the weight). Both mineralized and demineralized bone can be used for grafting purposes. Embodiments of the present invention encompass bone graft compositions containing mixtures of mineralized and demineralized bone, such that the compositions provide a bone allograft material having consistent calcium content, certain mechanical properties and handling characteristics, and desired biological activities. In one aspect, embodiments of the present invention encompass composite bone graft materials, and methods for their use and manufacture. An exemplary method of manufacturing a composite bone graft material for administration to a treatment site of a human patient may include selecting a target calcium content or handling characteristic of the bone graft material, selecting a first amount of mineralized (i.e., non-demineralized) donor bone material, selecting a second amount of demineralized donor bone material, and combining the first and second amounts of bone material so as to obtain a bone graft composition having the target calcium content or handling characteristic. In these or other embodiments, the first amount of mineralized donor bone material may be selected based on the target calcium content or handling characteristic. Relatedly, the second amount of demineralized donor bone material may be selected based on the target calcium content or handling characteristic. In some instances, a ratio of the first amount of mineralized donor bone material to the second amount of demineralized donor bone material may be selected based on the target calcium content or handling characteristic. In some embodiments, the donor is an allogeneic cadaveric donor. In some embodiments, the composite bone graft material includes tissue obtained from the patient. In some embodiments, methods may also include combining adult mesenchymal stem cells with the bone material. In another aspect, embodiments of the present invention may include a bone graft composition. The bone graft composition may include a first amount of non-demineralized cancellous bone, a second amount of demineralized cancellous bone, and a third amount of demineralized cortical bone.

For example, the third amount may be between about 10% and about 40%, between about 10% and about 30%, between about 15% and about 25%, between about 19% and about 21%, or about 20% of the volume of the bone graft composition in embodiments. In these or other embodiments, combining the first and second amounts of bone material may include combining the third amount with the first and second amounts. Prior to the combining step, the method may include seeding the mesenchymal stem cells onto the demineralized bone material. The method may include seeding a stromal vascular fraction onto the demineralized bone material, and the stromal vascular fraction may include mesenchymal stem cells and unwanted cells. In these or other embodiments, the method may include incubating the mesenchymal stem cells on the demineralized bone material for a period of time to allow the mesenchymal stem cells to adhere to the demineralized bone material. The method may include rinsing the seeded demineralized bone material to remove the unwanted cells from the demineralized bone material. In another aspect, embodiments of the present invention may include a method of treating a bone defect or other ailment in a patient. The method may include administering to the patient a bone graft composition that may include a first amount of non-demineralized cancellous bone, a second amount of demineralized cancellous bone, and a third amount of demineralized cortical bone. The non-demineralized cancellous bone, the demineralized cancellous bone, and the demineralized cortical bone may be obtained from the same cadaveric donor. The bone graft composition may be administered to treat spinal problems. With some spinal problems, the spine may need to be fused. In these or other embodiments, the bone graft composition may be placed in a spine cage, which may be placed between vertebrae. Additionally, the bone graft composition may be used to treat nonunions or critical size defects. In these or other embodiments, the bone graft composition may be applied or administered to the bone defect or surrounding bone. In yet another aspect, embodiments of the present invention may include a method of manufacturing a composite bone graft material for administration to a treatment site of a patient.

The above described and many other features and attendant advantages of embodiments of the present invention will become apparent and further understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

FIG. 4 depicts aspects of bone graft systems and methods according to embodiments of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Embodiments of the present invention encompass bone graft compositions and methods for their use and manufacture. Bone graft compositions as disclosed herein are provided with selected calcium content and/or handling characteristics. An exemplary manufacturing method may include selecting a target calcium content or handling characteristic of a bone graft composition, selecting a first amount of mineralized bone material, selecting a second amount of demineralized bone material, and combining the first and second amounts of bone material so as to obtain a bone graft composition having the target calcium content or handling characteristic. Demineralization Bone contains both mineralized and unmineralized components. For example the osteoid, which can be about 50% of the bone volume, is composed mainly of collagen. The mineralization of osteoid by inorganic mineral salts provides bone with its strength and rigidity. Bone contains several inorganic mineral components, such as calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, magnesium, fluoride, sodium, and the like. Typical demineralization procedures involve removing such mineral components from bone. Any of a variety of techniques can be used to demineralize bone, including hydrochloric acid treatments, and the like. Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) refers to allograft bone that has had the inorganic mineral removed, leaving behind the organic collagen matrix. The American Association of Tissue Banks typically defines demineralized bone matrix as containing no more than 8% residual calcium as determined by standard methods. In this sense, a fully demineralized bone tissue can be considered to have no more than 8% residual calcium. It has been observed that cells such as mesenchymal stem cells may exhibit an affinity for adhering with demineralized bone. Cortical Bone Cortical bone, also known as compact bone, can be found in the outer shell portion of various bones. Cortical bone is typically, dense, hard, strong, and stiff. Cortical bone may include bone growth factors. Cancellous Bone Cancellous bone, also known as spongy bone, can be found at the end of long bones. Cancellous bone is typically less dense, softer, weaker, and less stiff than cortical bone. Mineral Content of Bone Cortical bone and cancellous bone can be harvested from a donor individual using standard techniques. The mineral or calcium content of the harvested bone may vary. In some cases, cortical bone is about 95% mineralized and cancellous bone is about 35-45% mineralized. In some cases, cortical bone is about 73.2 wt % mineral content, and cancellous bone is about 71.5 wt % mineral content. In some cases, the mineral content of the starting bone material is about 25%, prior to demineralization. Composite Bone Materials Embodiments of the present invention encompass bone materials containing various mixtures of mineralized (or non-demineralized bone) combined with demineralized bone. For example, bone compositions may include fully demineralized bone (e.g. cortical and/or cancellous) combined with non-demineralized bone (e.g. cortical and/or cancellous). Non-demineralized bone may be bone that has not undergone any demineralization, including treatment with acid. Demineralized and non-demineralized bone can be combined a certain ratios to provide bone allograft material having consistent calcium content and/or consistent handling characteristics. Turning now to the drawings, FIG. 1 depicts aspects of bone composite systems and methods according to embodiments of the present invention. As shown here, as a typical demineralization method proceeds, the amount of calcium in the bone is rapidly depleted. What is more, the acid concentration used, the duration of the demineralization process, and the process temperature are factors which can operate to impact the residual calcium content in the bone. Moreover, there may be variation in the bone density (e.g. due to donor age and/or bone location) as well as in the bone particle size. Hence, it may be difficult to accurately obtain a partially demineralized bone material having a calcium content which is within the specified range, or that is at a particular desired or selected value within the range. Exemplary bone allograft compositions as disclosed herein contain a first amount of mineralized bone (A) and a second amount of demineralized bone (B). Hence, the bone allograft composition can have a consistent calcium content. Typically, the demineralized bone is provided as a demineralized bone matrix, or allograft bone which has had inorganic mineral removed, leaving behind the organic collagen matrix. As a result of the demineralization process, the DBM is more biologically active (e.g. BMPs were activated during demineralization process) than non-demineralized bone grafts. Conversely the mechanical or structural integrity properties of demineralized bone may be significantly diminished as compared to mineralized bone. Typically, cortical bone and cancellous bone are separated from one another, and then demineralized. For example, the cortical bone and cancellous bone can be demineralized in separate batches. FIG. 2 shows the steps in a method 200 according to embodiments of the present invention. The method 200 may include selecting a target calcium content or handling characteristic 202. The method 200 may include selecting a first amount of bone material 204. In these or other embodiments, the bone material may be non-demineralized bone material from a donor. The method 200 may include selecting a second amount of bone material 206. In some cases, the second amount of bone material may include demineralized bone material. The method 200 may include combining the first and second amounts 208. By combining mineralized and demineralized bone material, it is possible to obtain a resulting mixture having desirable handling characteristics, calcium content, and BMP activity. In some embodiments, particles sizes and/or volume percentages of components of the bone graft composition may be selected based on handling characteristics of the bone graft composition. Such handling characteristics may include compressibility and cohesion characteristics. Compressibility characteristics for bone graft compositions may include whether the composition is more like sand or more like a sponge. Cohesion characteristics for bone graft compositions may include compositions whether the composition sticks together or does not stick together. Compositions that are more like sand and do not stick together may be difficult for a physician to handle and administer to only the treatment site. Product that is too spongy may be harder for physicians to apply in consistent amounts across different treatments in part because in some instances, a physician may compress the spongy product more than in other instances. In some cases, composite materials may include components which are present in an amount that is within a volume percentage range. For example, demineralized cancellous bone may be present within a range between about 30% and about 70%, between about 40% and about 60%, between about 45% and about 55%, between about 48% and about 52%, or about 50%. The non-demineralized cancellous bone may be present within a range between about 30% and about 70%, between about 40% and about 60%, between about 45% and about 55%, between about 48% and about 52%, or about 50%. The demineralized cortical bone may be present within a range between about 10% and about 40%, between about 10% and about 30%, between about 15% and about 25%, between about 19% and about 21%, or about 20%. Such volumes may be based on the volume of the bone graft composition product. The cancellous particles may be more sponge-like and the cortical bone material may reside within spaces of the sponge-like cancellous particles. Hence, the sum of the starting volume amounts may exceed 100% of the final volume of the composite bone material. According to some embodiments, the volume of the final composition may largely be determined by the volumes of demineralized and non-demineralized cancellous components. Hence, a 40 ml volume of demineralized cancellous bone combined with a 40 ml volume of non-demineralized cancellous bone and a 20 ml volume of demineralized cortical bone may provide a composition having a final volume of 80 ml. In an exemplary embodiment, a composite bone material may have a calcium content within a range from about 10% to about 15%. In these or other embodiments, the bone graft composition may have a calcium content between about 10% and about 19%, between about 12% and about 17%, or about 15%. In some cases, an amount of mineralized cancellous bone present in the composite bone material may have a calcium content of about 20%. In some cases, an amount of demineralized cancellous bone present in the composite bone material may have a calcium content within a range from about 0% (or undetected) to about 8%. In some cases, an amount of mineralized cortical bone present in the composite bone material may have a calcium content of about 25%. In some cases, an amount of cortical demineralized bone present in the composite bone material may have a calcium content within a range from about 0% (or undetected) to about 8%. Examples of particle sizes of cancellous bone material may include between about 0.1 mm and about 9 mm, between about 2 mm and about 8 mm, between about 1 mm and about 7 mm, between about 1 mm and about 6 mm, between about 1 mm and about 5 mm, between about 0.1 mm and about 4 mm, between about 1 mm and about 4 mm, or between about 0.1 mm and about 1 mm, or between about 0.5 mm and about 4 mm in embodiments. Examples of particles sizes of cortical bone may include between about 100 \u03bcm and 2 mm, between about 1 mm and about 2 mm, between about 120 \u03bcm and about 710 \u03bcm, or between about 100 \u03bcm and 1 mm. Smaller particle sizes, including those of cortical bone material, may result in more BMPs being activated. Particle sizes may be obtained using a series of sieves to remove particles smaller and larger than a desired range. According to some embodiments, instead of adding a patient's own cancellous bone material to an implant graft composition to treat a fracture or other bone defect during a surgical procedure, it is possible to use non-demineralized cancellous bone in a composite bone material as discussed elsewhere herein. In some cases, the composite bone material will include bone obtained from an allogeneic donor. In some cases, both the demineralized and the mineralized components can be harvested from a common donor and combined to provide the composite bone material. Relatedly, the composite bone material can include cells (e.g. adult mesenchymal stem cells) obtained from the same donor. In some cases, the composite bone material may include bone obtained from a recipient patient. Hence, a composite bone material may include autologous demineralized and/or mineralized bone. In some embodiments, methods of manufacturing composite bone graft material may include seeding demineralized bone material with a stromal vascular fraction. The stromal vascular fraction may be formed by digesting adipose tissue. Digesting the adipose tissue may include making a collagenase I solution and filtering the solution, and mixing the adipose solution with the collagenase solution. The adipose solution with the collagenase I solution may be agitated in a shaker flask. This may provide the adipose tissue with a visually smooth appearance. The method may include aspirating a supernatant containing mature adipocytes so as to provide a pellet that is the stromal vascular fraction. The stromal vascular fraction may include mesenchymal stem cells and other cells, which may be unwanted or unneeded in embodiments of the invention. Unwanted cells may include hematopoietic stem cells and other stromal cells. In these or other embodiments, methods may include incubating the mesenchymal stem cells on the demineralized bone material for a period of time to allow the mesenchymal stem cells to adhere to the demineralized bone material. Methods may include rinsing the seeded demineralized bone material to remove all, substantially all, or a portion of the unwanted cells from the demineralized bone material in embodiments. Methods involving mesenchymal stem cells may be as disclosed in Ser. No. 12/612,583 filed Nov. 4, 2009 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/790,412 filed Mar. 15, 2013, the entire content of both is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. In some cases, the bone graft composition may be administered to a patient as a flowable, syringeable, putty-like material. For example, a putty-like moldable matrix can be delivered through a cannula or other syringe attachment to a treatment site. Such bone matrix compositions may be used as how soft tissue matrix compositions are used and formed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/712,295 filed Dec. 12, 2012, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. In some cases, the bone material and/or mesenchymal stem cells may be present in a morselized form. Hence, compositions and methods as disclosed herein may include a soft tissue or skin matrix material combined with stem cell morsels, so as to form a bone putty. A putty formulation may have good handling characteristics. For example, such morsels or putty compositions may stay in place upon implantation. Relatedly, such morsels or putty compositions may persist at the site of the application (e.g., bone defect area) and resist removal by irrigation and/or contact with blood. In some instances, flowable decellularized skin or de-epidermilized skin (or other soft tissue) can provide and effective carrier to hold demineralized bone material and/or mesenchymal stem cells in place and prevent their migration. Embodiments of the present invention may encompass delivering the bone graft composition combined with a carrier to a treatment site of the patient. In some cases, the carrier is derived from a human donor and includes an organic phase of a decellularized adipose tissue that has been exposed to alkaline organic solution. Such methods and compositions may be similar to those taught in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/970,324 filed Aug. 19, 2013, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. In these or other embodiments, methods may include administering treatment material combined with a matrix to a treatment site of a patient. The matrix may include a processed organic phase of decellularized adipose tissue that is substantially free of a stromal vascular fraction. In some cases, the adipose component includes an adipose derived carrier. FIG. 3 shows a method 300 of treating a bone defect in a patient according to embodiments. The method 300 may include providing a bone graft composition 302. In these or other embodiments, the bone graft composition may include any of the bone graft compositions described herein. The method 300 may include administering the bone graft composition to the patient 304. Example 1 In one example (FIG. 4), a composite bone material includes 50% fully demineralized cancellous bone (e.g. 0.5 mm to 4 mm particle size) seeded with cells (e.g. adult mesenchymal stem cells), 50% non-demineralized cancellous bone (e.g. 1 mm to 4 mm particle size), and 20% fully demineralized cortical bone (e.g. 1 mm to 2 mm particle size). Particle size ranges may be obtained by using two sieves to separate out ground bone material. According to some embodiments, the fully demineralized cortical bone may not contribute toward the final volume of the composite bone material, because the particle size is relatively small and can fill into pores of the larger cancellous particles. Example 2 In another example (FIG. 4), a composite bone material includes 50% fully demineralized cancellous bone (e.g. 0.5 mm to 4 mm particle size) seeded with cells (e.g. adult mesenchymal stem cells), 50% non-demineralized cancellous bone (e.g. 1 mm to 4 mm particle size), and 20% fully demineralized cortical bone (e.g. 120 \u03bcm to 710 \u03bcm particle size). According to some embodiments, the fully demineralized cortical bone may not contribute toward the final volume of the composite bone material, because the particle size is relatively small and can fill into pores of the larger cancellous particles. In each of these examples, it was observed that the allograft material exhibited consistent and satisfying handling characteristics. Hence, by combining a fully demineralized bone material (e.g. DBM) with a non-demineralized bone matrix material, it is possible to create a very consistent partially demineralized bone product, which may otherwise be difficult to produce using traditional demineralization approaches Relatedly, the product can have a consistent calcium content. Table 1 describes certain characteristics of various composite bone material formulations according to embodiments of the present invention. Each of the formulations in Table 1 includes 20% by volume of demineralized cortical bone. TABLE 1 Ratio in product: Calcium content demineralized in product cancellous bone to (e.g. amount of non-demineralized calcium present Handling Characteristics of cancellous bone in mixture) product (description) 0:1 (0% demin) 25% Hard sand like particles, does not stick together well 1:4 (25% demin) 19% Sand like particles, does not stick together well 1:1 (50% demin) 15% Sticks together very well, not too hard, not too spongy 3:4 (75% demin) 10% Sticks together well, slightly spongy 1:0 (100% demin) less than 8% Does not stick together well, very spongy According to some embodiments, bone graft material can be demineralized for 60 minutes in 1 N HCl during the process. To evaluate residual calcium content, samples of the morselized bone product were subjected to inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy analysis by SunLabs (Tampa, Fla.). The resulting residual calcium was 1.0%. Each value is well below the 8.0% residual calcium required by AATB to claim full demineralization. To evaluate certain characteristics of composite bone material, samples were manipulated by hand. For example, by squeezing or holding the material in the hand, it is possible to observe adhesion characteristics, for example by noting the extent to which the material sticks to one's fingers when extending the fingers. Similarly, by squeezing or holding the material in the hand, it is possible to observe cohesion characteristics, for example by noting the extent to which the material tends to adhere to itself. Further, by squeezing or holding the material in the hand, it is possible to observe compressibility characteristics, for example by noting the extent to which the material can be compressed. What is more, by squeezing or holding the material in the hand, it is possible to observe abrasiveness characteristics, for example by noting the shape and/or hardness of particles present in the material. When referring to the calcium content in the product, there may be various types of calcium, such as calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, and the like. For example, some bone material is formed mostly of calcium phosphate in the chemical arrangement termed calcium hydroxylapatite.
