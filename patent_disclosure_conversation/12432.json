    "patent_summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The purpose of this invention is to provide non-irritating protective formulations to be used as an adjunct in preventing the spread of a broad range of sexually transmitted diseases. The products of the present invention can be formulated as a topical lotion, cream, solution, emulsion, or the like, and will be hereinafter referred to as creams. Applicant's previous patent demonstrated that the use of antimicrobial/antiviral active agents in conjunction with film-forming excipients in the following formulations possessed unique skin protective barrier properties with enhanced persistence that inhibit \u201cskin to skin\u201d and \u201csore to sore\u201d transmission of pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, ectoparasites and mycoplasmas) linked to communicable diseases. Applicants have now discovered that equivalent skin protective barrier properties, with enhanced persistence, which are also effective in providing the inhibition of \u201cskin to skin\u201d and \u201csore to sore\u201d transmission of pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, ectoparasites and mycoplasmas) linked to communicable diseases, can be realized in the absence of an antimicrobial/antiviral agent. Skin protectant products are regulated under CFR 21 Part 347 \u201cSkin Protectant Drug Products for Over the Counter Human Use\u201d. The official description of a skin protectant is \u201ca drug product that temporarily protects injured or exposed skin or mucous membrane surfaces from harmful or annoying stimuli, and may help provide relief to such surfaces.\u201d These regulations cover applicable ingredients, as well as labeling requirements for over the counter skin protectants. Active ingredients officially classified as skin protectants compositions as well as certain combinations of these compositions are listed in the CFR 21 Sec. 347.10, reproduced in Table 1 below. In accordance with the instant invention, the phrase \u201ca skin protectant composition provided in a skin protecting effective concentration\u201d will be understood to mean any of the following ingredients within their designated range of concentrations: TABLE 1 Ingredient Concentration Allantoin 0.5 to 2.0% Aluminum hydroxide gel 0.15 to 5.0% Calamine 1.0 to 25.0% Cocoa Butter 50.0 to 100.0% Cod liver oil 5.0 to 13.56% (in accordance with Sec. 347.20(a) (1) or (a) (2), provided the product is labeled so that the quantity used in a 24-hr period does not exceed 10,000 USP Units vitamin A and 400 USP Units cholecalciferol.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to topical protective formulations for use in the prevention of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs); and particularly to unique topical formulations including a plurality of film forming excipients, which act in concert to provide a barrier to help inhibit the transmission of STDs. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a universal concern, effecting millions of individuals and straining health care systems. More than 20 different sexually transmitted diseases have been identified by the medical community and generally fall into two groups, including bacterial types (e.g., gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis) and viral types (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papilloma virus (HPV) and hepatitis). The numerous diseases affect men, women and children of all backgrounds, races and economic classifications. Despite years of research and educational programs, the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases remains a global health threat. Although specific methods of transmission may vary depending on the disease-causing organism, STDs are usually transmitted to the uninfected person through injured or exposed skin or mucous membranes during sexual contact. Treatments may be available for some types of STDs (e.g. antibiotic treatment for gonorrhea or chlamydia). However, most people who suffer from these types of STDs are unaware that they have the disease and therefore do not get the necessary treatment. Moreover, because of the sociological impact and generally negative stigma associated with these diseases, people are reluctant to seek such treatments. The continued emphasis on educating the population as to the use of \u201cmechanical barriers\u201d such as condoms has helped to decrease the morbidity of most STDs but more preventative methods need to be developed to prevent STD transmission. Chemical actives such as microbicides, antimicrobials, and spermicides, most notably, nonylphenoxypoly(ethyleneoxy)ethanol (also referred to as nonoxynol-9) have been used in topical formulations to effectively reduce the rate of STD transmission, especially when used in conjunction with prophylactics. However, many of these chemical actives are harsh and have been shown to induce local irritation, inflammation, and ulcerations, which might actually favor the transmission of STDs. Thus, a need exists for topical formulations that do not cause irritation and will help inhibit the spread of STDs, especially when used in combination with condoms, and thereby provide an additional degree of protection from contamination, should the condom become damaged. PRIOR ART Although there are numerous patents and publications directed to formulations containing chemical actives, such as, microbicides, antimicrobials, spermicides, and drug delivery carriers (liposomes, micelles), none of the known prior art teach formulations comprising non-irritating agents that provide a physical barrier to the permeation of pathogens. U.S. Patent Application 2003/0143189 A1 to Askill et al., is directed to a method of treating skin lesions by forming a polymeric film over the lesions to inhibit proliferation of infectious agents in the lesions. These compositions also include one or more chemical agents in combination therewith. U.S. Pat. No. 6,835,717 to Hildreth discloses a method of reducing the risk of a sexually transmitted pathogen by contacting a pathogen within the composition which consists of \u03b2-cyclodextrin. U.S. Pat. No. 6,821,958 to Hershline discloses a method of preventing viral transmission using an alkylsulfate derivative of sulfated dextrin as a topical formulation. U.S. Pat. No. 6,582,711 to Asmus et al., discloses an antimicrobial hydroalcoholic composition having a cationic polymeric thickener. U.S. Pat. No. 6,355,235 to Cone et al., consists of an antibody capable of trapping sperm and a pharmaceutical carrier. U.S. Pat. No. 6,328,991 to Myhling discloses a chemical composition to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases comprising nonylphenoxpoly-(ethyleneoxy)ethanol, benzalkonium chloride and povidone iodine. U.S. Pat. No. 5,439,685 to Augros is a composition of an agent active against microorganisms responsible for sexually transmitted diseases together with a film-forming agent such as dimethylpolysiloxane, and benzalkonium chloride as a spermicidal. U.S. Pat. No. 4,952,411 to Fox, Jr. et al., is a composition of silver sulfadiazine, alone or in combination with chlorhexidine or sodium deoxycholate (antimicrobial and detergent). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The purpose of this invention is to provide non-irritating protective formulations to be used as an adjunct in preventing the spread of a broad range of sexually transmitted diseases. The products of the present invention can be formulated as a topical lotion, cream, solution, emulsion, or the like, and will be hereinafter referred to as creams. Applicant's previous patent demonstrated that the use of antimicrobial/antiviral active agents in conjunction with film-forming excipients in the following formulations possessed unique skin protective barrier properties with enhanced persistence that inhibit \u201cskin to skin\u201d and \u201csore to sore\u201d transmission of pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, ectoparasites and mycoplasmas) linked to communicable diseases. Applicants have now discovered that equivalent skin protective barrier properties, with enhanced persistence, which are also effective in providing the inhibition of \u201cskin to skin\u201d and \u201csore to sore\u201d transmission of pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, ectoparasites and mycoplasmas) linked to communicable diseases, can be realized in the absence of an antimicrobial/antiviral agent. Skin protectant products are regulated under CFR 21 Part 347 \u201cSkin Protectant Drug Products for Over the Counter Human Use\u201d. The official description of a skin protectant is \u201ca drug product that temporarily protects injured or exposed skin or mucous membrane surfaces from harmful or annoying stimuli, and may help provide relief to such surfaces.\u201d These regulations cover applicable ingredients, as well as labeling requirements for over the counter skin protectants. Active ingredients officially classified as skin protectants compositions as well as certain combinations of these compositions are listed in the CFR 21 Sec. 347.10, reproduced in Table 1 below. In accordance with the instant invention, the phrase \u201ca skin protectant composition provided in a skin protecting effective concentration\u201d will be understood to mean any of the following ingredients within their designated range of concentrations: TABLE 1 Ingredient Concentration Allantoin 0.5 to 2.0% Aluminum hydroxide gel 0.15 to 5.0% Calamine 1.0 to 25.0% Cocoa Butter 50.0 to 100.0% Cod liver oil 5.0 to 13.56% (in accordance with Sec. 347.20(a) (1) or (a) (2), provided the product is labeled so that the quantity used in a 24-hr period does not exceed 10,000 USP Units vitamin A and 400 USP Units cholecalciferol.

Yet another objective of the invention is to teach products formulated as a lotion, cream, solution, emulsion, or other topically applied product. Other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description, wherein are set forth, by way of illustration and example, certain embodiments of this invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Detailed embodiments of the instant invention are disclosed herein, however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific functional and structural details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representation basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed structure. Zinc oxide is an inert, non-toxic chemical compound with the chemical formula of ZnO. Zinc Oxide can be used as a skin barrier. When applied to skin, Zinc Oxide acts as a mechanical barrier that physically excludes isolates and prevents the skin from any contact with harmful stimuli. Zinc Oxide is often used in creams or lotions and provides a continuous barrier, which also helps prevent the loss of active ingredients due to friction and rubbing. Because of its inert, non-toxic characteristics and general non-solubility in water, it can be applied to skin as many times as may be needed. While zinc oxide is the preferred skin protectant composition of the present invention, other suitable skin protectant compositions and their amounts effective to provide skin protection as listed in Table 1 above could be used herein (e.g., Dimethicone). Glycerin (INCI name: Glycerin) is a non-irritating humectant and film former. It is also water-soluble. Moreover, glycerin is compatible with latex products and provides extended lubricity, which makes it a common base for many products designed for genital use. Lanolin is a humectant isolated from wool-bearing animals such as sheep. It is a product of the sebaceous gland and consists mostly of a mixture of cholesterol and the esters of several fatty acids. It has many commercial uses, including within the medical and cosmetic industries. Benzalkonium Chloride is a member of the quaternary ammonium compounds. These compounds are a group of ammonium salts in which organic radicals have been substituted for all four hydrogens of the original ammonium cation. Benzalkonium Chloride has been reported to be an effective anti-viral wetting agent in the prevention of transmission of viral diseases such as HIV and herpes simplex virus. Benzalkonium Chloride is also listed in the FDA Topical Antimicrobial Drug Products Monograph as a First Aid Antiseptic. The phrase \u201cfilm-forming emollient\u201d refers to any excipient suitable for cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications, which forms a water-repelling film. According to a preferred, albeit non-limiting embodiment, the film-forming emollients are cetyl alcohol and cetostearyl alcohol. Cetyl alcohol (IUPAC name of 1-hexadecanol) is a member of the alcohol class of compounds. It is a solid organic compound and belongs to a group of fatty alcohols. In addition to its use as an emollient, it is often used in the cosmetic industry as a surfactant in shampoos, emulsifiers or thickening agents in the manufacture of skin creams and lotions. Cetostearyl alcohol is a blend of cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol, two fatty alcohols derived from vegetable sources. The phrase \u201csilicone-containing excipient\u201d refers to any silicone or silicone derivatives, including silicone-based skin protectants, suitable for cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications, which acts as an emollient and forms a water-repelling film, including silicone oils. In addition to skin barriers, silicone and silicone oils are highly substantive on the skin. As a result of this property, silicon and silicone oils are often used in topical formulations, such as creams and lotions, to improve the substantivity of active ingredients on the skin. After applying the topical formulations to the skin and removing volatile substances, the film formed as a result of using a silicone-containing excipient helps to maintain the active ingredient in close contact with the skin and prevents the loss of the active ingredient by abrasion. The ability to form hydrophobic films, which can easily be applied, and spread over skin accounts for high resistance to wash-off and rub-off. Use of silicones in topical formulations over petroleum-based products is more desirable because silicones do not exhibit the negative aesthetics of petroleum and, unlike petroleum, are known to be compatible with the materials used to manufacture condoms. According to one non-limiting embodiment, Dimethicone (preferably Dimethicone 20 cSt and Dimethicone 12500 cSt) is preferred. Dimethicone is a highly pure, non-volatile silicone fluid, which is colorless and odorless. It can be used as a lubricant and emollient skin protectant. Ceteareth-12 is part of a family with the INCI name of Ceteareth-n and refers to polyoxyethylene ethers of a mixture of high molecular mass saturated fatty alcohols. The \u201cn\u201d indicates the average number of ethylene oxide residues in the polyoxyethylene chain. Ceteareth-12 is a non-toxic surfactant, which is frequently used as an emulsifier in the cosmetic industry. The mixture of Cetearyl alcohol and Ceteareth-20 (EMULGADE 1000NI, Cognis Corporation) is a non-ionic, self-emulsifying base commonly used in the production of oil/water creams and lotions. Disodium Edetate, having the chemical name of disodium (ethylene-dinitrilo) tetra-acetate dihydrate, is also commonly known as the disodium salt of EDTA. The chemical acts as a chelating compound by preventing ingredients from binding to trace elements that may be present. Excipients useful in forming the skin protective creams, according to the present invention are described in the following non-limiting example. EXAMPLE 1 In formulating a batch of a skin protective cream according to the invention, active ingredients and excipients useful in the manufacture of this product, a particularly effective product resulted when ingredients were utilized within the following approximate ranges: ACTIVE INGREDIENTS/EXCIPIENT WT/WT % RANGES Water phase (1) DEIONIZED WATER Q.S. (2) EDETATE DISODIUM 0.01-0.1 (3) ZINC OXIDE 1.0-8.0 (4) GLYCERIN (USP) 2.0-10.0 Oil Phase (5) DIMETHICONE 20 10.0-20.0 (6) DIMETHICONE 12500 3.0-10.0 (7) CETEARYL ALCOHOL and/or 6.0-10.0 CETEARETH-20 (8) CETEARETH-12 0.5-3.0 (9) ANYHDROUS LANOLIN 0.5-3.0 (10) CETOSTEARYL ALCHOHOL 1.0-5.0 (11) CETYL ALCOHOL 1.0-5.0 A preferred, albeit non-limiting procedure for manufacture of the formulation comprises the steps of: Procedure: 1. Heat to 75\u00b0 C.\u2014Dimethicone 20\u2212, Dimethicone 12500, Cetearyl Alcohol and Ceteareth-20 (available as EMULGADE 1000 NI from Cognis), Ceteareth-12 (available as (EUMULGIN B1 from Cognis), Anhydrous Lanolin, Cetostearyl alcohol and Cetyl alcohol. Allow the materials to melt. 2. Dissolve Disodium Edetate in the deionized water (USP). 3. Heat Step #2 to 75-78\u00b0 C. 4. Disperse the Zinc Oxide in the Glycerin to form a homogeneous dispersion. 5. With high speed mixing, slowly add the materials from Step #3 (Water phase) to the materials from Step #1 (Oil phase). Initiate cooling. 6. When at 60\u00b0 C.; add the dispersion from Step#4 to the materials from Step #5 (Emulsion). 7. When at 50\u00b0 C., reduce mixing speed. 9. When at 40\u00b0 C., further reduce the mixing speed. 10. When at 25\u00b0 C. stop mixing. While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that these film forming excipients and active ingredient form a neutral and hydrophobic layer barrier which is also believed to interact with the skin thereby having a stabilizing effect upon the hydrophobic layer, which results in the enhanced persistence of the product. The use of a silicone-containing skin protectant, e.g. Dimethicone 20 and Dimethicone 12500, or a like equivalent, acts in coordination with at least one of the skin protectants compositions as defined in CFR 21 Sec. 347.10, e.g. Zinc Oxide, or others from Table 1, excipients and the film-forming emollients, and melts when contacted with the heat of the body. This in turn forms a physical hydrophobic layer that provides a barrier, which appears to inhibit penetration of liquids, and sexually transmitted pathogens (viral, bacterial) which are primarily hydrophilic in nature. This property helps protect the user from contamination due to sexual contact with infected individuals. In order to ascertain any differences between the use of the formulation as described herein, and a formulation additionally containing an antiviral, e.g. benzalkonium chloride, the following experiment was carried out. TABLE 1 SKIN BARRIER FORMULATION % (w/w) Dimethicone 20 (Dow coming Q7-9120 Silicone Fluid 15.030060120 Dimethicone 12500 (Dow Corning Q7-9120 Silicone 5.010020040 Fluid 12500 I cSt).

Additionally, a second formulation was prepared, to which the antiviral ingredient Benzalkonium Chloride (Benzalkonium Chloride 50% Solution, NF) was added in an amount of 0.20% w/w. A test protocol was followed in order to evaluate the barrier function of the cream product against fluid and virus transmission alone and with the addition of Benzalkonium Chloride. The challenge virus selected was Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2, ATCC VR-734. Three pieces of filter paper were weighed and placed onto a sterile glass Petri dish. Following, a piece of porous membrane (pore size 10 pm) was placed on top of the filter paper layer [except for Filter Paper Only (No Membrane) Control]. The carrier was pre-incubated at 37\u00b11\u00b0 C. (Actual, 37\u00b0 C.) for 10\u00b11 minutes (Actual, 10 minutes) with the lid off prior to further manipulation. To determine efficacy as a viral barrier, 1.00 g of test agent was spread evenly across the upper side of the membrane area. Thereafter, 0.2 mL of the challenge virus was applied evenly to the treated membrane. The carrier was covered, sealed in parafilm, and incubated at 37\u00b11\u00b0 C. (Actual, 37\u00b0 C.) for 30\u00b11 minutes (Actual, 30 minutes). To determine efficacy as a moisture barrier, during the carrier preparation/pre-incubation step, 1.00 g of test agent was spread evenly across the upper side of the membrane area. Following, the carrier was incubated at 37\u00b11\u00b0 C. (Actual, 37\u00b0 C.) for 10\u00b11 minutes (Actual, 10 minutes). Thereafter, 0.2 mL of cell culture medium was applied evenly to the treated membrane. The carrier was covered, sealed in parafilm, and incubated at 37\u00b11\u00b0 C. (Actual, 37\u00b0 C.) for 30\u00b11 minutes (Actual, 30 minutes). It was assayed for moisture adsorption only. To determine moisture penetration of the filter paper, after the contact time, the membrane if applicable, was carefully lifted and removed. The filter paper layer was weighed to measure moisture adsorption. To determine viral penetration, the filter paper layer was placed in a 50-mL sterile tube with 15-mL of recovery medium. The filter paper layer was squeezed with a cell scraper. Following, the tube was vortexed on a vortex-type mixer for 1-2 minutes and held at room temperature for about 5 minutes. The tube was then vortexed using a vortex-type mixer for an additional 1-2 minutes; it was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was collected and passed through a 0.45 pm syringe filter prior to use in diluting and plating.
