No. 14/109,193, filed Dec. 17, 2013, which is a continuation of and claims the benefit of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/792,977, filed Mar. 11, 2013, now abandoned. The entirety of each application is incorporated herein by reference. STATEMENT REGARDING GOVERNMENT SUPPORT This invention was made with government support under N00014-07-1-0255 awarded by the NAVY/ONR. The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many bacteria utilize small molecule or peptidic signals to assess their local population densities in a process termed quorum sensing (QS). [1-3] This chemical signaling process effectively allows bacteria to \u201ccount\u201d themselves and behave as a group at high cell number. While the specifics may vary between species, QS circuits share general organizing principles: bacteria produce, secrete, and detect signal molecules referred to as autoinducers. At high population densities in a given environment, the autoinducers will reach a sufficiently high concentration to bind and activate their cognate (intracellular or extracellular) receptors. Signal:receptor binding then alters the expression of genes involved in bacterial group behaviors, such as swarming, sporulation, bioluminescence, conjugation, biofilm formation, and virulence factor production. [4-6] These phenotypes can have widespread and sometimes devastating effects on human health, agriculture, and the environment.[7,8] For example, pathogenic bacteria utilize QS to launch synchronized attacks on their hosts only after they have achieved a high cell density, thereby overwhelming the defense mechanisms of the host.[9-11] As several prevalent human pathogens (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) use QS to control virulence, QS has received considerable recent attention as a new anti-infective target.[12] There has been significant interest in the development of non-native ligands (e.g., small molecule and peptides) capable of blocking QS pathways. In contrast to antibiotics, which target bacterial pathways that are essential for survival, QS antagonists provide an alternative anti-infective therapy that does not place selective pressure on the bacterial population to develop resistance.[13,14] This is especially important in the case of S. aureus, which rapidly develops resistance to antibiotics, including resistance to the once last-resort antibiotic vancomycin.[15] S. aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium that uses QS to establish both acute and chronic infections.[16,17] This pathogen produces an impressive arsenal of virulence factors, including tissue-degrading enzymes, immune evasion factors, and pore-forming toxins (hemolysins), all of which are regulated by the accessory gene regulator (agr) QS system.[18-20] The agr system has four components, termed AgrA-D, as illustrated in FIG. 1A, and is centered on the autoinducing peptide (AIP) QS signal. AgrB is an integral membrane endopeptidase that converts the precursor of the AIP signal, AgrD, to the mature AIP. This conversion involves cyclization of AgrD via a cysteine sulfhydryl group and its C-terminus to form the AIP as a 16-atom thiolactone macrocycle with an N-terminal exocyclic tail (shown in FIG. 1B). AgrB is also involved in the secretion of AIP across the cell membrane. Once a threshold concentration of AIP is reached in a given environment, the AIP ligand binds to its target receptor AgrC, a transmembrane histidine kinase. The AIP:AgrC complex acts to phosphorylate the response regulator, AgrA. Phosphorylated AgrA then binds to the P2 and P3 promoters to autoinduce the agr system and upregulate RNAIII transcription.[21] RNAIII thus represents the main effector of the agr system and regulates the expression of many virulence factors and surface proteins associated with biofilm production.[22] There is a hypervariable region within the S. aureus agr operon that has led to the classification of four agr specificity groups of S. aureus (I-IV) with distinct AIP and AgrC sequences.[23-25] The structures of the four AIP signals (I-IV) are shown in FIG. 1B. The four AIP signals have a conserved 16-atom thiolactone macrocycle, and AIPs I and IV share a nearly identical primary sequence, while AIP-II and AIP-III have more dissimilar primary sequences. The four different agr groups have been correlated with specific disease types: group-I and -II are associated with the majority of invasive infections,[26-28] while group-IV is considered rare and limited to exfoliative toxin-related syndromes.[26] Group-III S. aureus has recently been reported to be the most abundant group in nasal carriage cases and to be predominately responsible for toxic shock syndrome (TSS) in humans.[26,27] Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) is the causative agent all cases of menstrual TSS and most cases of nonmenstrual TSS.[26,29] Notably, TSST-1 production is directly regulated by the agr-III QS system (FIG. 1A).[18,29,30] Methods to inhibit the agr-III system in S. aureus could provide new insights into and therapeutic strategies for this deadly disease. QS is dependent on autoinducer:receptor binding, and the development of chemical agents capable of blocking this binding event have been a focus of considerable research.[31-33] Both small molecules and macromolecules have been utilized to block native autoinducer binding, largely in Gram-negative bacteria.[34,35] Such abiotic agents can be useful in anti-infective treatments.[36-38] The development of small molecules that affect AgrC signaling in S. aureus has proceeded more slowly. Janda et al. [35,44] have recently reported a complimentary strategy based on antibodies that sequester the AIP ligand away from AgrC and effectively \u201cquench\u201d QS in group-IV S. aureus. McCormick and co-workers have reported that naturally occurring cyclic dipeptides produced by Lactobacillus reuteri can modulate the agr system in S. aureus. [29] Early studies of the AgrC systems reported that each of the native AIPs were capable of cross-inhibiting the other three, non-cognate receptors.[23,45-47] This activity was suggested to provide each group some competitive advantage when establishing an infection, and to explain in part the predominance of a single S. aureus group in many infection types.[23,48] Given the prevalence of group-I and -II systems in clinically relevant infections, AIP-I and AIP-II have so far received the most scrutiny for the design of AgrC modulators.[24,45,46,49-52] Studies by Muir, Novick, Williams, and co-workers examined the structure activity relationship (SAR) of AIP-I and AIP-II, [53-55] and reported certain non-native mimetics of these peptides that were capable of inhibiting both their cognate and non-cognate AgrC receptors in S. aureus. There are two components to AIP:AgrC interactions: initial recognition and induction of an allosteric response that drives activation. The core AIP-II macrocycle was reported to be important for recognition because linear native peptides and mimetics of AIP-II were completely inactive.[45] In addition, these studies reported that the two structural elements of AIPs, the macrocycle and the exocyclic tail, are responsible for AgrC:AIP recognition and AgrC activation, respectively. [55] Interactions of AIPs with non-cognate AgrC receptors were reported to be inhibitory, namely through AIP:AgrC recognition, alterations to the exocyclic tails did not significantly affect cross-inhibition. The AIP macrocycle alone is reported sufficient for cross-group inhibitory activity. Within the AIP-I and AIP-II macrocycles, the hydrophobic residues at the C-termini were reported to be essential for cognate and non-cognate AgrC recognition.[24,45,49] Consistent with these observations, Muir et al. reported several potent and global inhibitors of all four AgrC receptors.[49] The most active inhibitor was reported to be a truncated version of AIP-I that lacked an exocyclic tail and had an aspartic acid to alanine mutation in the macrocyclic core (tAIP-I D2A): Peptidomimetics are a powerful tool for studying and understanding SARs of peptides and proteins. [67] Modifications can be introduced to gather information regarding the importance of specific amide and hydrogen bonds within a peptide backbone and to identify conformational restrictions and structural elements important to overall activity while simultaneously enhancing pharmacological properties. [68-73] Peptidomimetics, with enhanced metabolic stability and permeability, can be useful as drug leads. [67, 74] For instance, N-methyl amino acids and N-substituted glycine derivatives (peptoids) can be inserted into or formed into peptides generating fully or partially N-methylated peptides, peptoids or peptide-peptoid (peptomer) hybrids which can be used to provide valuable SAR insights. For example, Muir and co-workers [51] performed a N-methyl scan of the truncated version of AIP-II pointing to the utility of such studies for AIP SAR. The SARs that dictate the activity of AIP-III remain largely unknown, and mimetics thereof are yet to be reported. Molecules which affect QS in group-III S. aureus are of particular interest because of the prevalence of infections of these group-III species in human TSS.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES FIG. 1A provides a schematic illustration of the agr quorum sensing circuit in S. aureus. (a) The precursor peptide AgrD is processed by AgrB. (b) The mature AIP signal is secreted across the cell membrane. (c) AIP binds the extracellular domain of AgrC. (d) The histidine kinase domain of AgrC phosphorylates AgrA. (e) AgrA binds the P2 and P3 promoters to autoactivate the agr system and upregulate RNAIII transcription. In selected S. aureus strains, RNAIII promotes the production of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). FIG. 1B provides the structures and sequences of the four AIP signals (IIV) corresponding to the four S. aureus groups. FIGS. 2A-2D provide a set of four competition dose response agonism curves (FIGS. 2A-2D) for the native AIPs (I-IV) in the presence of AIP-III D4A at 2 nM (group-I (FIG. 2A) and group-II (FIG. 2B)) or 0.3 nM (group-III (FIG. 2C) and group-IV (FIG. 2D)) in the group-I-IV fluorescence reporter strains. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean of triplicate values. FIG. 3 is a graph illustrating attenuation of TSST-1 production in wild-type group-III S. aureus (MN8) using selected compounds of the invention. Bacteria were either untreated (black bar, 1), treated with AIP analogs at 10 nM (light gray bars, 2) or 1 nM (white bars, 3), or treated with previously reported cyclic dipeptides at 100 \u03bcM (dark gray bars, 4). TSST-1 concentrations are presented as percentage of the TSST-1 concentration in untreated cultures. FIG. 4 illustrates exemplary peptidomimetics of this invention. FIG. 5 illustrates exemplary compounds of this invention of formula V. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention is based at least in part on the synthesis of structural variants of the AIP-III cyclic peptide and assessment of the activity of API-III structural variants for modulation of one or more of the four AgrC receptors of Staphylococcus aureus. Structural variants include those generated by alanine, D-amino acid, N-methylated amino acid and peptoid scans of AIP-III. Additional structural variants examined include double- and triple mutated variants, amino-truncated and amino-elongated variants.

THE EXAMPLES Example 1 Synthetic Methods Linear peptides were synthesized on Boc-protected, amino acid pre-loaded 4-hydroxymethyl-phenylacetamidomethyl (PAM) resin (0.6-0.8 mmol/g) using standard solid-phase synthesis protocols. All chemical reagents were purchased from commercial sources (Alfa-Aesar, Sigma-Aldrich, and Acros) and used without further purification. Solvents were purchased from commercial sources (Sigma-Aldrich and J. T. Baker) and used as obtained, with the exception of anhydrous dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), which was stored over molecular sieves. Water (18 M\u03a9) was purified using a Millipore Analyzer Feed System. Solid-phase resin was purchased from Chem-Impex International. Cyclic dipeptides (cyclo-(Tyr-Pro) and cyclo-(Phe-Pro)) controls were synthesized according to a previously reported method.[57] Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was performed using a Shimadzu system equipped with an SCL-10Avp controller, an LC-10AT pump, an FCV-10ALvp solvent mixer, and an SPD-10MAvp UV/vis diode array detector. An analytical Phenomenex Gemini C18 column (5 \u03bcm, 4.6 mm\u00d7250 mm, 110 \u212b) was used for analytical RP-HPLC work. A semi-preparative Phenomenex Gemini C18 column (5 \u03bcm. 10 mm\u00d7250 mm, 110 \u212b) was used for preparative RP-HPLC work. Standard RP-HPLC conditions were as follows: flow rates=1 mL min\u22121 for analytical separations and 5 mL min\u22121 for semi-preparative separations; mobile phase A=18 MO water+0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); mobile phase B=acetonitrile (ACN)+0.1% TFA. Purities were determined by integration of peaks with UV detection at 220 nm. Peptide thioesters were purified using a linear gradient (75%\u219245% A over 30 min). Cyclic peptides were purified using a linear gradient (70%\u219255% A over 27 min). Overall sample purity was determined using a linear gradient (90%\u21925% A over 27 min). MALDITOF mass spectrometry (MS) data were obtained on a Bruker RELEX II spectrometer equipped with a 337 nm laser and a reflectron. In positive ion mode, the acceleration voltage was 25 kV. Exact Mass (EM) data were obtained on a Waters (Micromass) LCT ESI-TOF spectrometer. The samples were sprayed with a sample cone voltage of 20 V. Peptide Synthesis. Two solid-phase synthesis approaches have been implemented in the past to construct native AIPs and their analogs. The first approach utilizes chemoselective cleavage of the linear, protected peptide from the solid support with concomitant unmasking of the cysteine sulfhydryl group. The protected peptide can then be macrocyclized via a carbodiimide coupling and subsequently deprotected. [24,50,61] This approach, however, is limited in part by the (i) poor solubilities of the protected peptides and (ii) low macrocyclization efficiencies due to the steric bulk of the protecting groups. The second synthetic approach addresses these challenges by incorporating an initial global deprotection step prior to a solution phase, chemoselective thiol-thioester exchange to form the macrocyclic products.[45,49] This latter approach is generally more efficient and has the potential for even further improvement. This general strategy was used to synthesize compounds of Table 1 herein. First, standard Fmoc/tBu solid-phase peptide synthesis methods to generate the linear peptides on 4-hydroxymethyl-phenylacetamidomethyl (PAM) polystyrene resin (Scheme 1). Cleavage and global deprotection according to the method of Hilvert et al. gave the linear peptide thioesters,[51,62,63] which were then purified to homogeneity by semi-preparative RP-HPLC and isolated in acceptable yields (25-50%). Intramolecular thiol-thioester exchange reactions in a range of buffers was assessed to Studies were then undertaken to develop macrocyclization conditions. It was found that found that performing the macrocyclization reaction in 6 M guanidinium chloride in 0.1 M phosphate buffer:ACN (3:2, vol:vol) at a pH=6.8 gave quantitative macrocyclization within 24 h at room temperature. Elevating the temperature to 50\u00b0 C. reduced reaction times to less than 2 h. These conditions were used to effect macrocyclization of all the AIP analogs prepared in this study (Table 1). This synthesis protocol was also used to generate AIPs I-IV and the known global AgrC inhibitor, tAIP-I D2A, for use as controls. Overall, this synthetic route represents an improvement over previously reported methods.[45,49,51] Further, the thiol-thioester exchange reaction conditions described herein can also be used in other contexts, for example, in the total synthesis of proteins using native chemical ligation. [64] Dawson et al. (1994) [64] is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for a description of the synthesis of polypeptides by native chemical ligation. These synthetic methods were employed to prepare the compounds of Table 1. Initially a set of 13 compounds were prepared in which the amino acids of AIP-III were evaluated through systematic alanine and D-amino acid point mutations. This initial set of 13 peptides (Table 1) was designed to identify key residues and stereocenters for AIP-III:AgrC interactions. Six of the seven residues were modified in the alanine scan with Cys3 maintained for thiolactone formation. All seven residues were evaluated in the D-amino acid scan. A second set of compounds was synthesized to include two and three alanines, alternate aromatic residues in place of Phe5, and to truncate and elongate exocyclic tails.

Representative Peptide Synthesis To deprotect the resin, a portion of resin (50 mg) was first swelled by suspension in CH2Cl2 (2 mL) for 30 min at rt and then drained. The resin was then treated with TFA (50% in CH2Cl2, 2 mL, 2\u00d72 min, rt) and washed with dimethylformamide (DMF; 3\u00d72 mL). To couple each amino acid, Fmoc-protected amino acids (2 equiv. relative to resin), 2-(1Hbenzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU; 2 equiv.), and diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA; 2 equiv.) were dissolved in DMF (2 mL). The solution was allowed to pre-activate for 1 min prior to being added to the resin and agitated for 1 h at rt. After each coupling step, the resin was drained and washed with DMF (2\u00d72 mL). To remove the Fmoc-protecting group after each coupling, the resin was treated with piperidine (2 mL of 20% in DMF, 2\u00d710 min) and washed with DMF (3\u00d72 mL). To acetylate the amino terminus, acetic anhydride (10 equiv.) and DIPEA (7 equiv.) were dissolved in DMF (2 mL), and the solution was added to the resin and agitated for 15 min. The resin was then drained and washed with DMF (2\u00d72 mL). Upon synthesis of a complete linear peptide sequence, the resin was washed with diethyl ether (1\u00d72 mL) and dried under vacuum for 48 h. Peptide Cleavage Protocol The linear peptidyl-resin (70-90 mg) was placed in a dry, three-neck round bottom flask and suspended in anhydrous CH2Cl2 under argon at rt for 15 min. Me2AlCl (20 equiv., 1 mL of 1 M hexane solution) and anhydrous CH2Cl2 (3 mL) were stirred in a separate, dry round bottom flask under argon for 5 min at 0\u00b0 C. Ethanethiol (EtSH) (60 equiv.) was added drop-wise at 0\u00b0 C., and the solution was stirred for 15 min at 0\u00b0 C. This solution was then added to the suspended resin and stirred under argon for 5 h at rt to effect cleavage of the linear peptide as a thioester. The cleavage product solution was transferred into a new round bottom flask containing a TFA solution (95% (aq.), 3 mL) and the solvents were removed in vacuo to yield a yellow or orange oil. The resulting oil was subjected again to TFA solution (3 mL, 30 min) and filtered from the resin. The resin was washed with TFA solution (1\u00d72 mL) to collect any additional peptide. A cooled solution of diethyl ether:hexane (1:1, 40 mL, 0\u00b0 C.) was added to the filtrate, and the peptide was allowed to precipitate overnight in a freezer at \u221220\u00b0 C. The precipitated peptide solution was centrifuged and the supernatant removed to yield a white solid. This solid was dissolved in acetonitrile (ACN) (50% (aq.)), lyophilized, redissolved in ACN (50% (aq.)) and purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC. Collected HPLC fractions were lyophilized to yield the linear peptide thioester as a white powder (25-50% isolated yields). Representative Peptide Macrocyclization Protocol Purified peptide thioester was dissolved in a 60% guanidinium chloride (6 M solution in 0.1 M phosphate buffer):40% ACN solution to a final concentration ranging from 100 \u03bcM to 2 mM. The pH of the solution was then adjusted to 6.8. The peptide was gently agitated using a multi-purpose rotator at 50\u00b0 C., and cyclization was monitored by analytical RP-HPLC. Upon completion, cyclic peptide was purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC and lyophilized. The resulting white powder was then dissolved in 1 Mhydrochloric acid (400 \u03bcL) and lyophilized prior to bioanalysis. Example 2 Peptidomimetics Two sets of peptidomimetics, resulting from an N-methyl scan and a peptoid scan of AIP-III, were prepared to assess backbone-amide hydrogen bond interactions and conformational restrictions of the AIP-III scaffold. These peptidomimetics are illustrated in FIG. 4. The method of Example 1 involving initial synthesis of linear peptidyl thioesters using Fmoc peptide assembly on PAM resin followed by chemoselective cyclization was not suitable for the synthesis of peptides containing N-alkylated amino acids at the C-terminus. It is well-known that a side reaction, diketopiperazine (DKP) formation, is observed for C-terminal proline-containing peptides and N-methylated peptides.[51, 76, 77] To circumvent this side reaction and minimize DKP formation, the linear peptidomimetic thioesters were synthesized in a Boc/Fmoc hybrid peptide assembly: the three C-terminal residues (Phe-Leu-Leu) were introduced using Boc chemistry and the four N-terminal residues (IIe-Asn-Cys-Asp) were introduced using Fmoc chemistry (Scheme 2). To introduce peptoid residues, a sub-monomer protocol was used, [75] while commercially-available N-methylated amino acids were introduced through standard protocols. Zuckermann et al. 1992 [75] is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for methods of synthesis of compounds of this invention. This hybrid synthetic route provided all of the compounds of FIG. 4 in acceptable yields, with the exception of AIP-III nN2 that was found to further react in aqueous solutions. All products were purified to homogeneity by RP-HPLC and obtained in \u02dc mg scale. Synthetic Methods Peptidomimetic AIP-III derivatives that were not modified at the C-terminus residue (Leu7) were synthesized using Boc-protected, L-leucine pre-loaded PAM resin (0.8 mmol/g). To synthesize the AIP-III N-Me-L7 derivative, Fmoc-N-Me-Leu-OH was manually loaded on aminomethyl polystyrene (AM) resin: AM resin (100 mg, 1.17 mmol/g) was swelled in diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA; 10% in CH2Cl2; 2 mL) for 10 min. The resin was washed with DIPEA (10% in CH2Cl2; 3\u00d71 mL) and dimethylformamide (DMF; 3\u00d72 mL). 4-(bromomethyl) phenyl acetic acid (1.4 equiv.) and N,N\u2032-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC; 1.7 equiv.) were dissolved in CH2Cl2. The solution was added to the resin for overnight agitation at rt. The resin was washed with DMF (3\u00d72 mL) and CH2Cl2 (3\u00d72 mL), then suspended in DMF. Fmoc-N-Me-Leu-OH (2 equiv.) and DIPEA (4 equiv.) were dissolved in DMF and added to the resin for overnight agitation at rt. The resin was washed with DMF (2\u00d72 mL) and CH2Cl2 (2\u00d72 mL), then treated with a solution of acetic anhydride (10 equiv.) and DIPEA (7 equiv.) in DMF for 15 min. The resin was then washed with DMF (2\u00d72 mL) and CH2Cl2 (2\u00d72 mL), followed by chloranil test to determine the absence of free amines (see procedure below). To synthesize the AIP-III nL7 analog, bromoacetic acid was manually loaded on PAM resin: PAM resin (100 mg, 0.85 mmol/g) was swelled in minimal amount of DMF (1 mL) for 30 min. Bromoacetic acid (10 equiv.) was dissolved in dry CH2Cl2 at 0\u00b0 C. DIC (5 equiv.) was added, the reaction was stirred at 0\u00b0 C. for 20 min and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The resulting solid was dissolved in minimal amount of DMF (1 mL) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP; 0.1 equiv.) was added. The solution was added to the resin and agitated for 1 h at rt. The solvent was drained and the resin was washed with DMF (2\u00d72 mL) and CH2Cl2 (2\u00d72 mL). To swell the resins: the resin (50 mg) was first suspended in CH2Cl2 (2 mL) for 30 min at rt and then drained. To remove the Boc-protecting group: the resin was treated with TFA (50% in CH2Cl2, 2 mL, 2\u00d72 min, rt) and washed with DMF (3\u00d72 mL). To couple each amino acid after Boc removal: the standard in situ neutralization/activation protocol was used. [78] Boc/Fmoc-protected amino acids (4 equiv.), 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU; 4 equiv.), and DIPEA (6 equiv.) were dissolved in DMF (2 mL). The solution was allowed to pre-activate for 2 min prior to being added to the resin and agitated for 30 min at rt. After each coupling step, the resin was drained and washed with DMF (2\u00d72 mL). To remove the Fmoc-protecting group: the resin was treated with piperidine (2 mL of 20% in DMF, 2\u00d710 min) and washed with DMF (3\u00d72 mL). To couple each amino acid after Fmoc removal: Boc/Fmoc-protected amino acids (2 equiv.), HBTU (2 equiv.), and DIPEA (2 equiv.) were dissolved in DMF (2 mL). The solution was allowed to pre-activate for 1 min prior to being added to the resin and agitated for 1 h at rt. To couple bromoacetic acid: bromoacetic acid (10 equiv.) was dissolved in DMF (2 mL). DIC (10 equiv.) was added and the solution was pre-activated for 20 min. The solution was added to the resin and the reaction was agitated for 30 min. The resin was drained and the procedure was repeated. The resin was washed with DMF (2\u00d72 mL) and CH2Cl2 (2\u00d72 mL), followed by chloranil test to determine the reaction completion (see procedure below). To couple primary amines to the bromoacetic acid: the amine (10 equiv.) was dissolved in DMF (2 mL). DIPEA (10 equiv.) was added and the solution was allowed to pre-activate for 1 min prior to being added to the resin and agitated overnight using a multi-purpose rotator at 50\u00b0 C. The resin was washed with DMF (2\u00d72 mL) and CH2Cl2 (2\u00d72 mL), followed by chloranil test to determine the presence of free amines (see procedure below). To couple amino acids to secondary amines: Boc/Fmoc-protected amino acids (4 equiv.), 2-(7-Aza-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU; 4 equiv.), and DIPEA (4 equiv.) were dissolved in DMF (2 mL). The solution was allowed to pre-activate for 1 min prior to being added to the resin and agitated for 2 h at rt. The resin was washed with DMF (2\u00d72 mL) and CH2Cl2 (2\u00d72 mL), followed by chloranil test to determine the reaction completion (see procedure below). If the test indicated that free amines are still present, the procedure was repeated and the reaction was left overnight at 50\u00b0 C. After the second coupling cycle, peptide elongation was continued even if the chloranil test indicated that free amines are still present. To carry out the chloranil test: A sample containing 1-3 mg of the resin was withdrawn and placed into a test tube. Acetaldehyde (2% in DMF; 2 drops) and chloranil (2% in toluene; 2 drops) were added to the sample. The solution was agitated at rt for 5 min. A green or blue color of the beads is a positive indication for the presence of free amines, indicating deprotection of the protecting group or incomplete coupling reaction. PAM Resin Cleavage Protocol Upon synthesis of a complete linear peptide sequence, the resin was washed with diethyl ether (1\u00d72 mL) and dried under vacuum for 48 h. The linear peptidyl-resin (90 mg) was placed in a dry, three-neck round bottom flask and suspended in anhydrous CH2Cl2 under argon at rt for 15 min. Me2AlCl (20 equiv., 1 mL of 1 M hexane solution) and anhydrous CH2Cl2 (3 mL) were stirred in a separate, dry round bottom flask under argon for 5 min at 0\u00b0 C. Ethanethiol (EtSH) (60 equiv.) was added drop-wise at 0\u00b0 C., and the solution was stirred for 15 min at 0\u00b0 C. This solution was then added to the suspended resin and stirred under argon for 5 h at rt to effect cleavage of the linear peptide as a thioester. The cleavage product solution was transferred into a new round bottom flask containing a TFA solution (95% (aq.), 3 mL) and the solvents were removed in vacuo to yield a yellow or orange oil. The resulting oil was subjected again to TFA solution (3 mL, 30 min) and filtered from the resin. The resin was washed with TFA solution (1\u00d72 mL) to collect any additional peptide. A cooled solution of diethyl ether:hexane (1:1, 40 mL, 0\u00b0 C.) was added to the filtrate, and the peptide was allowed to precipitate overnight in a freezer at \u221220\u00b0 C. The precipitated peptide solution was centrifuged and the supernatant removed to yield a white solid. This solid was dissolved in ACN (50% (aq.)), lyophilized, redissolved in ACN (50% (aq.)) and purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC. Collected HPLC fractions were lyophilized to yield the peptide thioester as a white powder (5-20% isolated yields). Peptide Cyclization Protocol Purified peptidomimetic thioester was dissolved in a 60% guanidinium chloride (6 M solution in 0.1 M phosphate buffer):40% ACN solution to a final concentration ranging from 100 \u03bcM to 2 mM. The pH of the solution was then adjusted to 6.8. The peptide was agitated using a multi-purpose rotator at 50\u00b0 C. for 2 h. The cyclic peptide was purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC and lyophilized. The resulting white powder was then dissolved in 1M hydrochloric acid (400 \u03bcL) and lyophilized. AIP-III nN2 The AIP-III nN2 thioester reacted immediately after purification to quantitatively generate an alternative product 17 mass units lower than expected. MS/MS analysis of the final product confirmed that DKP is formed between the N-terminus and the amide of the nAsn residue side chain. A recent study by Br\u00e4se and co-workers [79] also reported the formation of DKP when nAsn-type residues were introduced at a position adjacent to the N-terminal residue. The formation of DKP did not hinder the AIP thioester cyclization and produced a bicyclic AIP-III analog after purification. Furthermore, in the AIP-III nD4 analog, where the Asp4 residue was replaced with its peptoid residue counterpart (see FIG. 4), DKP formation was not observed despite common understanding that basic conditions enhance amine nucleophilicity and that ester bonds are more susceptible to cleavage than amide bonds.[74, 75, 76]. Example 3 Biological Reagents and Strain Information All standard biological reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used according to enclosed instructions. Suspended rabbit blood cells (10%, washed and pooled) were purchased from Lampire Biological Laboratories and stored at 4\u00b0 C. until use in the hemolysis assay. Reagents for the TSST-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were purchased from Toxin Technology, Inc. Tryptic soy broth (TSB) and brain heart infusion (BHI) were prepared as instructed with pH=7.35. The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 2. Bacterial cultures were grown in a standard laboratory incubator at 37\u00b0 C. with shaking (200 rpm) unless noted otherwise. The bacterial dilutions and incubation periods were chosen in each assay to provide the greatest dynamic range between positive and negative controls for each bacterial strain. Absorbance and fluorescence measurements were obtained using a Biotek Synergy 2 microplate reader using Gen5 data analysis software. All biological assays were performed in triplicate. IC50 values were calculated using Graph Pad Prism software (v. 4.0) using a sigmoidal curve fit. TABLE 2 S. aureus strains used in the biological assays listed according to group. Assay-type Strain Reference Fluorescence group-I AH1677 58 group-II AH430 58, 59 group-III AH1747 58 group-IV AH1972 58 Hemolysis group-I RN6390B 22 group-II RN6923 23 group-III MN8 60 group-IV RN4850 25 \u03b2-Lactamase group-I RN9222 49 group-II RN9372 49 group-III RN9532 49 group-IV RN9371 49 Compound Handling Protocol. Stock solutions of synthetic AIP compounds (1 mM) or cyclic dipeptides (10 mM) were prepared in DMSO and stored at 4\u00b0 C. in sealed vials. The amount of DMSO used in biological screens did not exceed 2% (v/v). Polystyrene 96-well microtiter plates (Costar) were used for screening. Example 4 Fluorescence-Based Reporter Gene Assays The ability of compounds (e.g. of Table 1 or FIG. 4) to modulate the activity of the AgrC I-IV receptors was assessed using a fluorescence-based reporter gene assays (described below). Each compound was tested in group I-IV methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains harboring P3-gfp reporter plasmids.[58,59] In these reporter plasmids, the agr P3 promoter, typically upstream of the main QS effector RNAIII, is positioned upstream of gfp. Thus, when bacterial cell densities and AIP concentrations are high, the AIP:AgrC complexes will phosphorylate AgrA, which will then bind P3 and transcribe gfp. GFP fluorescence can then be quantified to determine the extent of AgrC activation, and in these wild-type strains, will be observable in the absence of an exogenous AgrC modulator. Compounds capable of reducing fluorescence levels (or increasing these levels over background), therefore, can be classified as AgrC inhibitors (or activators). In order to validate the reporter assay conditions and have controls for comparison to the new compounds, the activities of the native AIPs I-IV and the previously reported global inhibitor tAIP-I D2A [49] in also evaluated in each S. aureus reporter strain. The inhibitory trends for these peptides in each of the four AgrC receptors were comparable to previous reports using alternate S. aureus AgrC I-IV reporter strains. [49] Table 3 summarizes the activities of these control peptides and the compounds of the alanine and D-amino acid scans of AIP-III against AgrCs I-IV. The reporter gene assay data revealed several interesting SAR trends for AIP-III, and a number of new, global AgrC inhibitors were uncovered with either comparable if not more potent activities than the known inhibitor tAIP-I D2A. There are two components to AIP:AgrC interactions: the initial recognition of an AIP by an AgrC receptor and the resultant induction of allosteric changes within AgrC that drives activation. To explore these components, two different SAR trends were examined: (i cross-inhibition of AgrC-I, -II, and -IV (namely AIP:AgrC recognition), and (ii) activation of AgrC-III (via allosteric changes). D-amino acid and alanine replacement of either of the exocyclic tail residues (IIe1 or Asp2) of AIP-III resulted in compounds with similar cross-inhibitory activities to the parent AIP-III (Table 3, IC50 values within error or <10-fold change). In addition, replacement of any one of the three hydrophobic, endocyclic residues in AIP-III (Phe5, Leu6, or Leu7) with alanine resulted in a significant loss of inhibition in groups-I, -II, and -IV (>10-fold change relative to AIP-III). Replacement of Phe5 and Leu6 with their D-amino acid counterparts displayed a >20-fold loss in inhibition in almost every case. However, AIP-III D-L7 displayed analogous inhibitory activities as the parent AIP-III in groups-I, -II and -IV (within error), suggesting that Leu7 may not enforce stereodefined interactions of AIP-III with AgrC receptors. This observation is congruent with previous findings for AIP-I by Williams and co-workers.[24] Two exceptions to these activity trends are noted. Replacing the endocyclic Phe5 or Leu6 with their D-isomers (in AIP-III D-F5 and AIP-III D-L6) neither maintained nor simply abolished inhibitory activity against one receptor, AgrC-II. These two analogs appeared to activate AgrC-II instead. The extent of this activation relative to native AIP could not be fully explored using the gfp-reporter assay, however, as the native AIP signals are produced at normal background levels in the S. aureus AgrC reporter strains (and thus an additive agonistic effect is measured). The remaining two residues of AIP-III, Cys3 and Asp4, were found to contribute significantly to cross-receptor inhibition. The replacement of Cys3 with its D-isomer significantly reduced inhibition (>20-fold change relative to native AIP-III; Table 3). This reduction may be due to a conformational change caused by the reversed stereogenic center of cysteine, forcing a change in the orientation of the key hydrophobic residues in the macrocyclic backbone, thereby preventing AIP:AgrC recognition interactions. Replacement of Asp4 with its D-isomer also reduced inhibition relative to AIP-III against AgrC-I by 28-fold, yet reduced inhibitory activity to a lesser degree against AgrC-II and AgrC-IV (4- and 3-fold relative to AIP-III, respectively). This result suggests that the stereochemistry of this residue could reinforce optimal orientations of Phe5 and Leu6 for interactions with AgrC-I. The remaining two residues of AIP-III, Cys3 and Asp4, were found to contribute significantly to cross-receptor inhibition. The replacement of Cys3 with its D-isomer significantly reduced inhibition (>20-fold change relative to native AIP-III; Table 3). This reduction may be due to a conformational change caused by the reversed stereogenic center of cysteine, forcing a change in the orientation of the key hydrophobic residues in the macrocyclic backbone, thereby preventing AIP:AgrC recognition interactions. Replacement of Asp4 with its D-isomer also reduced inhibition relative to AIP-III against AgrC-I by 28-fold, yet reduced inhibitory activity to a lesser degree against AgrC-II and AgrC-IV (4- and 3-fold relative to AIP-III, respectively). This result suggests that the stereochemistry of this residue could reinforce optimal orientations of Phe5 and Leu6 for interactions with AgrC-I. Perhaps more notable, however, was that the replacement of Asp4 with alanine (AIP-III D4A) increased the inhibitory activity of AIP-III by at least 10-fold in each group, delivering a picomolar global AgrC inhibitor. Interestingly, AIP-III D4A contains the identical mutation as the previously reported global inhibitor, tAIP-I D2A (residue numbering shifted (4a\u21922) due to truncated structure), yet is a \u02dc10-fold more active inhibitor in each group (Table 3). AIP-III D4A represented not only the most active inhibitor identified in this first series of AIP-III derivatives, but is also, to our knowledge, the most potent AgrC inhibitor to be reported.

Analysis of the gfp screening data for the AIP-III analogs also provided valuable SAR trends for the activation of AgrC-III by AIP-III (Table 3). The exocyclic residue Ile1 of AIP-III appeared to play an important role in receptor activation. Replacing this residue with either alanine or the D-amino acid counterpart converted AIP-III to a weak antagonist (IC50 values=194 nM and 78.3 nM, respectively). Converting the exocyclic residue Asn2 to its D-isomer yielded an even stronger AgrC-III antagonist (IC50 value=17.8 nM). However, replacing Asn2 with alanine maintained agonistic activity, suggesting that the stereochemical presentation (and concomitant conformational constraints) of the peptide backbone may be more essential for AgrC-III activation relative to the composition of the Asn2 side chain. Within the AIP-III macrocycle, the two hydrophobic residues Phe5 and Leu6 proved to be crucial for AgrC-III activation, as D-isomer or Ala replacements at either of these residues gave relatively inactive analogs that only weakly inhibited AgrC-III activity (IC50 values >200 nM). In contrast, AIP-III D-L7 maintained the agonistic activity of the parent AIP-III, while AIP-III L7A was largely inactive, similar to the AIP-III F5A and AIP-III L6A mutants. This disparate activity trend suggests that Leu7 may not play as a major of a role in AIP-III:AgrC-III interactions as Phe5 and Leu6. Replacement of the AIP-III Cys3 with its D-isomer gave a weakly active inhibitor (IC50 value >200 nM; Table 3), indicating that the stereochemistry of this residue is important to AIP-III:AgrCIII interactions. Similarly, substitution of Asp4 with D-Asp also yielded an inactive analog (IC50 value >200 nM). As discussed above, however, replacing this same residue with alanine (AIP-III D4A) produced the most potent AgrC-III inhibitor in this series (IC50 value=0.0506 nM). Together, these SAR trends indicate that Asp4, adjacent to the conserved Cys3 residue, plays a major role in AgrC activation, but not in recognition by the receptor. Throughout these SAR analyses, it was assumed that the AIP-III analogs were eliciting their activity through directly binding AgrC receptors and outcompeting the native AIP signals. This is a reasonable assumption in view of the structural relationship of these mutants to the native AIP signals, and has been made in prior studies of AIP-I and -II analogs. However, to provide further support for this hypothesis, we performed a competition assay between the native AIPs and our most potent AgrC-III inhibitor, AIP-III D4A, using the gfp reporter strains. The native AIP signals could be added in a dose-dependent manner to completely eliminate AIP-III D4A inhibition and recover gfp production in each of the four S. aureus groups (see FIGS. 2A-D). These data serve to support a competitive mechanism by which AIP-III D4A and the related analogs in this study modulate AgrC activity. Table 3 also summarizes the activities of these control peptides and the peptidomimetics of FIG. 4. As noted above, exocyclic residues of AIPs are required for cognate activation but not receptor recognition. Consistent with previous observations, peptidomimetics with modifications to the exocyclic tail residues had activities similar to the parent AIP-III. AIP-III nN2 could not be directly evaluated, but note that the bicyclic AIP-III nN2 DKP significantly lost ability to inhibit AgrC-I (>20-fold change). With respect to changes in the macrocycle, the importance of the conserved cysteine and three hydrophobic residues was confirmed as most of such modifications resulted in significant reduction of potency (>9-fold change). Furthermore, modifications of Leu6 resulted in AgrC-II agonists, an observation similar to that observed on its replacement with the D-amino acid. While, Phe5 could not be mutated to a D-amino acid or alanine without loss of activity, Phe5 could be mutated with peptidomimetics. For example, the replacement of Phe5 with the N-methyl analog had no effect on inhibition relative to AIP-III (IC50 values within error) and the insertion of a peptoid residue resulted in a picomolar group-IV inhibitor. AIP-III nF5 was the most potent inhibitor identified for any group in these studies and displayed enhanced potency for AgrC-IV only (versus AIP-III: 10-fold increased potency for AgrC-IV, within error for AgrC-I, and 13-fold reduction for AgrC-II). In contrast replacement of Leu7 with the N-methylated or peptoid analog abolished inhibition where peptoid insertion resulted in an AgrC-II agonist. The combined results indicate that the side chain of Phe5 (but not the backbone) is the important component of this residue, and the backbone is the important component of Leu7. Based on these results, the AIP segment spanning from the Phe5 \u03b1-carbon to the nitrogen atom of Leu7 appears to be the basis for AgrC recognition. The SAR analysis also provided information related to AgrC-III activation by AIP-III. Agonism of AgrC-III was not detected for any of the backbone-modified analogs, indicating that hydrogen bonding throughout the entire sequence is important for activation. However, the utilization of wild-type bacteria in our assay prevents accurate assessment of this phenomenon. Furthermore, of the 13 peptidomimetic analogs of FIG. 4, only AIP-III nN2 DKP was found to be an AgrC-III inhibitor. This analog also significantly reduced TSST-1 production by a group-III S. aureus strain in low \u03bcM concentrations. Examination of the peptidomimetics of FIG. 4 identified group-selective inhibitors. Two selective inhibitors were identified after replacement of Asp4 with either the N-methyl amino acid or the corresponding peptoid: AIP-III N-Me D4 and AIP-III nD4, respectively. These compounds were both selective AgrC-II and -IV inhibitors (IC50 values for AgrC-I and -III were greater than 100 nM). This result is consistent with observation regarding the replacement of Asp4 with its D-stereoisomer, which only exhibited weak inhibition activity against AgrC-I, but maintained antagonism activity against AgrC-II and -IV in the gfp reporter assay. The intolerance of AgrC-I to changes at Asp4 may be attributable to the sequence of the cognate AIP that has an Asp residue at the same position. Additionally an AgrC-IV selective inhibitor, AIP-III N-Me-L6, was identified on N-methylation of Leu6 of AIP-III. The selectivity obtained through this subtle change in the AIP structure emphasizes the specificity of the interactions between the AIPs and the AgrC receptors. Further, two partially selective inhibitors, AIP-III nF5 and AIP-III nN2 DKP (IC50 values vary significantly between the groups) were identified. Group-selective inhibitors, for example, are useful as research reagents to study the agr QS circuit of S. aureus in mixed bacterial milieu. Group-selective inhibitors provide a method to temporally evaluate mixed strains to probe not only strain-strain competition, but also to assess the role of QS timing on a strain's success or failure in such competition. Compounds of Table 1 with double and triple alanine changes, alternate aromatic residues in place of Phe5, and truncated and elongated exocyclic tails were evaluated in the four S. aureus gfp-reporter strains for inhibitory activity against AgrC-I-IV. The results of these assays are shown in Table 4; data for AIP-III D4A, and the previously reported inhibitor, tAIP-I D2A, are included for comparison.

The analogs with double and triple alanine mutations (Table 4, Rows 1-4) were designed to examine whether simultaneously replacing multiple amino acid residues with alanine would result in an additive effect on compound activity. Replacing both exocyclic residues (Ile1 and Asn2) in AIP-III with alanine yielded an analog (AIP-III I1A/N2A) with an IC50 value between those of the parent single alanine mutants for AgrC-I, -II, and -IV (see Tables 3 and 4). In contrast, AIP-III I1A/N2A was a much more potent inhibitor against AgrC-III (IC50=2.60 nM) relative to the single alanine mutants (I1A, IC50=194 nM; N2A=weak agonist). Introducing a D4A mutation along with these exocyclic alanine mutations (Table 4, Rows 2-4) yielded analogs with antagonistic activities analogous to the AIP-III D4A parent mutant, regardless of other mutations (within error for all except AIP-III I1A/D4A against AgrC-II, with a <5-fold change), indicating that the inclusion of D4A may convert every AIP-III mutant to cross-group AgrC inhibitor. Four truncated AIP-III derivatives lacking exocyclic tails were prepared to explore whether this modification, as shown for AIP-I, -II and -IV,[49] could broaden their inhibitory scope against cognate and non-cognate AgrC receptors (Table 4, Rows 5-8). Such an analysis of the native AIP-III is yet to be reported. It was found that the truncated AIP-III (tAIP-III) was largely inactive in its cognate receptor, AgrC-III. Moreover, no significant activity change between tAIP-III and native AIP-III against AgrC-II and -IV was observed, and slightly diminished activity for tAIP-III relative to native AIP-III against AgrC-I (26.7 nM v. 5.05 nM, respectively) was observed. These data suggest that the exocyclic tail of AIP-III does not play a major role in cross-group inhibition. The inclusion of the D4A mutation in the truncated AIP-III produced a potent global AgrC inhibitor (termed tAIP-III D2A; <1 nM for all groups; note, residue numbering shifted due to truncation), with activity within error of its full-length analog (AIP-III D4A) in AgrC-I, -II, and -IV and only somewhat reduced for group-III (0.329 nM v. 0.0506 nM, respectively). This truncated AIP-III analog represents a more structurally streamlined, peptide-based AgrC inhibitor. To explore SARs for the potent inhibitor tAIP-III D2A, Phe3 was replaced with other aromatic amino acids (Tyr or Trp) to determine the role of this residue in inhibitory activity. These two analogs (tAIP-III D2A/F3Y and tAIP-III D2A/F3W) displayed similar inhibitory activities in the gfp-reporter assays as the parent analog. These data, along with the alanine scan data above, suggest that bulky, aromatic residues are important at the Phe3 (or Phe5) position for AgrC inhibition by AIP-III analogs, but that the residue identity is not critical. Four elongated AIP-III analogs with either an acetyl, glycine, alanine, or tyrosine extension at the N-terminus of AIP-III. The tyrosine-extended AIP-III (Y-AIP-III) was a moderate antagonist of AgrC-III in the gfp-reporter assay. In contrast, the acetylated and glycine variants (Ac-AIP-III and G-AIP-III) were largely inactive in AgrC-III, and the alanine-extended AIP (A-AIP-III) was actually a partial agonist of AgrC-III instead. When evaluated for modulatory activity in the non-cognate AgrC receptors, Ac-AIP-III was the least active (>200 nM for group-I and -IV and 44.3 nM for group-II), implying that a free N-terminus is important for recognition. None of the amino acid AIP-III analogs showed improved inhibition compared to the parent AIP-III, and G-AIP-III was the least potent extended amino acid analog overall. Interestingly, the A-AIP-III, but not Y-AIP-III- (Tyr being first amino acid in the native AIP-IV octapeptide sequence), actually displayed partial agonism in AgrC-IV. Representative Assay Protocol. Peptide stock solutions were diluted with DMSO in serial dilutions (either 1:3, 1:5, or 1:10), and 2 \u03bcL of the diluted solution was added to each of the wells in a black 96-well microtiter plate. An overnight culture of S. aureus gfp strain was diluted 1:50 with fresh TSB (pH 7.35). A 198-\u03bcL portion of diluted culture was added to each well of the microtiter plate containing peptide. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 h. Fluorescence (EX 500 nm/EM 540 nm) and OD600 of each well was then recorded using a plate reader and IC50 values were calculated. For the competition assays, 2 \u03bcL of AIP-III D4A stock solution was added to wells in a black 96-well microtiter plate to final concentrations of 2 nM (group-I and -II strains) or 0.3 nM (group-III and -IV strains). Native AIP (I-IV) stock solutions were diluted with DMSO in serial dilutions (1:3 dilutions) and added to the wells containing AIP-III D4A. The fluorescence assay was carried out as described above in the four respective S. aureus reporter strains. Example 5 Hemolysis Assays The response of S. aureus gfp-reporters may not accurately reflect physiologically relevant QS phenotypes. Previous studies have established that the production of hemolysins is regulated by the agr QS system.[18-20] Therefore, analogs that inhibit the agr system should also block the production of hemolysins in S. aureus. Inhibition of the agr system should then be readily quantitated by hemolysis assays using red blood cells. To this end, a standard bacterial hemolysis assay was modified to a 96-well microtiter plate format to expedite compound screening [65, 66] All 13 compounds evaluated in Table 3 were further evaluated for their ability to inhibit hemolysis by S. aureus. Wild-type strains of S. aureus groups-I-IV were treated with compounds to be tested and the cultures were then assessed for hemolysin activity. Rabbit red blood cells were incubated with peptide-treated bacterial cultures (\u02dc15 min) in a microtiter plate, after which the samples were pelleted by centrifugation. The culture supernatant was then transferred to new plates, and the concentration of free heme (directly correlated with red blood cell lysis) was quantified by measuring absorbance at 420 nm. Similar to the gfp-reporter assays outlined above, the native AIPs (I-IV) and the previously reported global inhibitor tAIP-I D2A as controls in the hemolysis assays. Table 5 summarizes the hemolysis assay data. With a few minor exceptions, the relative IC50 value trends for the controls and AIP analogs in the hemolysis assay were largely identical to those in the gfp-reporter assays. Note that the two sets of assay data came from different bacterial strains, and thus strain-to-strain variations could account for the slight deviations observed. The most potent AgrC inhibitors identified in the gfp-reporter assays were capable of completely inhibiting hemolysis in the S. aureus strains at nanomolar concentrations or lower. For example, the global S. aureus QS inhibitor identified in the gfp-reporter assay, AIP-III D4A, inhibited hemolysis in all four groups at subnanomolar concentrations (IC50 value <0.2 nM). This peptide was three-fold more active than the previously reported global inhibitor, tAIP-I D2A, in the hemolysis assay in the group IV strain; more strikingly, it was 40-fold more active in the group-II strain. These data are significant, as they indicate that AIP-III D4A and other compounds of this invention are capable of blocking an important QS phenotype directly linked to virulence in wild-type S. aureus strains.

The most potent AgrC inhibitors from Table 4 (IC50 values less than 1 nM) were also evaluated in the S. aureus hemolysis assay (Table 6). The trends for these compounds analogs in the hemolysis and gfp-reporter assays are largely consistent. The hemolysis assay did unmask variances between certain potent compounds. For example, AIP-III I1A/D4A inhibited hemolysis in group-I at eightfold lower concentrations than the original AIP-III D4A analog (0.0103 nM v. 0.0820 nM, respectively), a discrepancy that was not observed in the gfp reporter assays (0.328 nM v. 0.485 nM), suggesting that double mutants may enhance the inhibitory activity of AIP-III analogs. AIP-III D-D4 was a strong AgrC-IV antagonist in the gfp assay (IC50 value=29.2 nM), but displayed partial agonism in the hemolysis assay (IC50 value >200 nM).

Suspended rabbit red blood cells (1 mL) were centrifuged (2,000 rpm, 2 min, 25\u00b0 C., 450 g), the supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended in saline phosphate buffer (PBS, pH=7.35, 1 mL). After the OD600 of each well of the 96-well microtiter plate was recorded, a 13-\u03bcL portion of the suspended red blood cells was added to each well. After 15-25 min (see Table 7) of static incubation at 37\u00b0 C., the microtiter plates were centrifuged to pellet the cells (4 min, 25\u00b0 C., 450 g). A 150-\u03bcL portion of supernatant from each well of culture was transferred to a fresh 96-well microtiter plate. Absorbance at 420 nm was measured for each well using a plate reader and IC50 values were calculated. Example 6 Attenuation of TSST-1 Production The production of TSST-1 is a hallmark QS phenotype S. aureus group-III. The four most potent AgrC inhibitors identified above (AIP-III D4A, tAIP-III D2A, AIP-III N2A/D4A, and AIPIIII1A/N2A/D4A) were evaluated for the capability of reducing the production of TSST-1 in group-III S. aureus. A wild-type group-III S. aureus strain (MN8) known to produce TSST-1 in the presence of each AIP-III analog (at 1 and 10 nM), and quantitated toxin production using a standard sandwich-type ELISA assay with a commercially available anti-TSST-1 antibody. The results of these assays are shown in FIG. 3, and show that all four AIP-III analogs are capable of strongly inhibiting TSST production (by >80%) in this group-III S. aureus strain at 10 nM. Moreover, two analogs, AIP-III D4A and tAIP-III D2A, maintained 80% reduction of TSST-1 levels at 1 nM. These ELISA data are significant, as they demonstrate that compounds of this invention are capable of inhibiting TSST-1 production in S. aureus. Previously, bacterial supernatants containing the naturally occurring cyclic dipeptides (cyclo-(Tyr-Pro) and cyclo-(Phe-Pro)) were reported by McCormick and co-workers.[29] to reduce TSST-1 production levels by \u02dc80% using an analogous ELISA assay. The purified cyclic dipeptides, however, were not tested in the ELISA. To perform a more quantitative comparison of the most potent AIP-III analogs to these cyclic peptides, pure samples of cyclo-(Tyr-Pro) or cyclo-(PhePro) were subjected to the ELISA protocol, and it was found that \u02dc100 \u03bcM concentrations were required to reduce TSST production by \u02dc50% or 80%, respectively (see FIG. 3). These data indicate that the compounds of this invention tested are at least 1000-fold more potent than the cyclic dipeptides in the ELISA, and thus represent some of the most potent inhibitors of TSST-1 production in S. aureus to be reported. TSST-1 ELISA Assay Protocol The TSST-1 ELISA protocol was based in part on the procedure supplied by the toxin producer (Toxin Technologies, Inc.), with some modifications. Peptide stock solutions (AIP-III analog or cyclic dipeptide control) were diluted with DMSO to the desired concentration, and 20 \u03bcL of the diluted solutions was added to 15-mL Falcon tubes. An overnight culture of S. aureus MN8 was diluted 1:100 with fresh BHI (pH 7.35), and a 1-mL portion of diluted culture was added to each Falcon tube containing peptide. The cultures were incubated at 37 \u25a1C for 24 h. Simultaneously, rabbit polyclonal anti-TSST-1 IgG (100 \u03bcL, 10 \u03bcg/mL in coating buffer (0.01 M sodium carbonate, pH 9.6)) was added to a 96-well ELISA plate and incubated with shaking (200 rpm) in a humid chamber at 37\u00b0 C. for 18 h. The ELISA plate was then washed 3\u00d7 (300 \u03bcL each, PBS solution containing 0.05% Tween-20, PBS-Tween). To block the plate, bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1% in PBS-Tween, 100 \u03bcL) was added to each well and incubated for 15 min at rt, after which it was washed 3\u00d7 again with PBS-Tween (300 \u03bcL each). The bacterial cultures were centrifuged to pellet the cells (10 min, 25\u00b0 C., 450 g), and the supernatants were sterile filtered. The supernatants were diluted 1:10 in normal rabbit serum (NRS, 1% in PBS-Tween) and incubated for 15 min at rt. The incubated solutions were further diluted using PBS-Tween to a total dilution of 1:100 to 1:2,000. The diluted supernatant samples (100 \u03bcL) and TSST-1 standards with known concentrations (ranging from 10 ng/mL to 0.32 ng/mL, 100 \u03bcL) were added to the ELISA plate and incubated with shaking (200 rpm) in a humid chamber at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 h. After incubation, the plate was washed 3\u00d7 with PBS-Tween, and anti-TSST-1 IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (100 \u03bcL, 3.33 \u03bcg/mL) was added and incubated with shaking (200 rpm) in a humid chamber at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 h. The plate was washed 5\u00d7 with PBS-Tween, after which 2,2\u2032-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-sulfonic acid) (ABTS solution, 100 \u03bcL) was added and incubated at rt for 15 min. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured using a plate reader, and a TSST-1 standard curve was constructed for each assay plate using the data of the TSST-1 reference standards. (The R2 of linear regression analysis for these data was 0.99.) The TSST-1 concentration in the test samples were then determined from the regression equation and presented as a percentage of the TSST-1 concentration in the untreated cultures. Example 7 Activation Assay-\u03b2-Lactamase Assay Peptidomimetic compounds of FIG. 4 that displayed <100% inhibition of gfp production in the wild-type strains were assessed for agonistic activity using a set of S. aureus group-I agr-null strains each carrying a plasmid containing a P3-blaZ fusion (to confer \u03b2-lactamase activity in response to AgrC activation) and agrCA from groups-I, -II, -III, or -IV. [46, 49]. None of peptidomimetics of FIG. 4 were able to activate the non-cognate AgrC receptors in the activation assay. Only the ability of the N-methyl and peptoid scans of AIP-III to activate the AgrC-III receptor is presented in Table 8. Four of the compounds tested were found to activate AgrC-III. N-methylation of Asn2 produced an analog with enhanced activity compared to AIP-III (Table 8), combined with the relatively high antagonistic activity of AIP-III nN2 DKP, this result suggests that N-alkylation of Asn2 is beneficial for AgrC-III interactions. N-methylation of Cys3 resulted in an analog with reduced activity compared to AIP-III (>10-fold change, Table 5), further highlighting the importance of this residue for effective AgrC receptor recognition. Modifying Phe5 did not hamper the ability of the resulting analogs to activate AgrC-III (Table 8). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the AIP segment spanning from the Phe5 \u03b1-carbon to the nitrogen atom of Leu7 is the basis for AgrC recognition.

An overnight culture of S. aureus \u03b2-Lactamase strain was diluted 1:50 with fresh BHI (pH 7.35) and the bacteria was incubated in a shaker until it reaches early exponential phase (OD600=0.16). A 50-\u03bcL portion of culture was added to each well of the microtiter plate containing peptide. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 h. OD600 of each well was recorded using a plate reader, followed by the addition of sodium azide (5 \u03bcL of 50 mM solution) and Nitrocefin solution (50 \u03bcL of 132 \u03bcg/mL in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8). The plate was shaken in an incubator at 37\u00b0 C. in the dark for 20 min, the absorbance (495 nm) of each well was then recorded and EC50 values were calculated. Example 8 Synthesis of Compounds of Formula V and Biological Assessment of Inhibition of AgrC Receptor Groups Synthetic methods described above were employed to prepare compounds of Formula V, and VA-C which are illustrated in FIG. 5. Scheme 3 illustrates the application of these methods to the synthesis of these compounds. FIG. 5 illustrates the naming scheme for certain compounds of Formula V which is used in Table 9. Table 9 provides a comparison of activity of certain compounds of formula V for inhibition of AgrC Receptor Groups of S. aureus. Table 9 lists % activation for each listed compound for AgrC groups I-IV. Percent activation is a comparison of fluorescence measurements (performed essentially as described in Example 4) of treated bacteria to non-treated wild-type bacteria (S. Aureus) which produce native-ligand which activates QS in the absence of an inhibitor; a lower % activation indicates more potent inhibition. This study identifies several compounds which potently inhibit AgrC receptors at the nM level. Specifically compound designated n3LF is a global inhibitor of all four AgrC receptors. Specifically, the compound designated n2LF is a selective group-II inhibitor. Specifically, the compounds d designated n5LF and n7LF are selective group-III inhibitors. Structures of certain compounds of formula V are listed below indicating IC50 values for inhibition of listed AgrC receptors: TABLE 9 Comparison of Relative Inhibition of Compounds of Formula V for AgrC groups Compound AgrC-Ia AgrC-IIa AgrC-IIIa AgrC-IVa designation % Activation % Activation % Activation % Activation n1LF 114 \u00b1 21 117 \u00b1 25 137 \u00b1 14 115 \u00b1 9 n2LF 104 \u00b1 15 2 \u00b1 0 138 \u00b1 9 99 \u00b1 14 n3LF 17 \u00b1 7 28 \u00b1 10 13 \u00b1 7 6 \u00b1 3 n4LF 99 \u00b1 30 88 \u00b1 52 120 \u00b1 28 110 \u00b1 14 n5LF 76 \u00b1 42 78 \u00b1 37 6 \u00b1 3 120 \u00b1 19 n6LF 69 \u00b1 20 3 \u00b1 0 6 \u00b1 3 80 \u00b1 21 n7LF 54 \u00b1 34 43 \u00b1 25 7 \u00b1 3 98 \u00b1 14 n1LL 108 \u00b1 14 72 \u00b1 20 139 \u00b1 35 119 \u00b1 17 n2LL 87 \u00b1 20 83 \u00b1 30 88 \u00b1 9 110 \u00b1 7 n3LL 86 \u00b1 24 62 \u00b1 14 113 \u00b1 10 119 \u00b1 11 n4LL 80 \u00b1 9 75 \u00b1 22 83 \u00b1 16 102 \u00b1 10 n5LL 87 \u00b1 10 88 \u00b1 24 105 \u00b1 40 119 \u00b1 17 n6LL 81 \u00b1 18 82 \u00b1 40 107 \u00b1 23 129 \u00b1 15 n7LL 103 \u00b1 64 76 \u00b1 28 117 \u00b1 28 122 \u00b1 15 n1LI 90 \u00b1 13 82 \u00b1 22 141 \u00b1 32 141 \u00b1 18 n2LI 89 \u00b1 61 44 \u00b1 23 135 \u00b1 42 130 \u00b1 17 n3LI 72 \u00b1 19 64 \u00b1 18 106 \u00b1 13 126 \u00b1 18 n4LI 55 \u00b1 8 36 \u00b1 18 106 \u00b1 48 132 \u00b1 18 n5LI 60 \u00b1 6 31 \u00b1 12 43 \u00b1 9 70 \u00b1 28 n6LI 68 \u00b1 16 41 \u00b1 13 93 \u00b1 26 133 \u00b1 17 n7LI 126 \u00b1 57 92 \u00b1 72 109 \u00b1 19 103 \u00b1 4 a% Activation is a comparison of fluorescence of treated bacteria to non-treated wild-type bacteria (S.
