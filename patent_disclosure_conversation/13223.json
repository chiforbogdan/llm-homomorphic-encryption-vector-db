No. 62/210,326, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure relates generally to superposition multiple access communication technologies, and more particularly, to Multi-User Superposition Transmission (MUST) in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). BACKGROUND The adoption of superposition multiple access is a recent development in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). See, e.g., Chairman's Notes, 3GPP RAN1 Meeting #80b, Belgrade (2014-04-20). Although often referred to in 3GPP as Multi-User Superposition Transmission (MUST), superposition multiple access techniques has various names and various types, including, and not limited to, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), Semi-Orthogonal Multiple Access (SOMA), Rate-adaptive constellation Expansion Multiple Access (EMA), Downlink Multiple User (DL MU), etc. The present disclosure is not limited to any of the afore-mentioned technologies, but has wide applicability to any superposition communication technology. In general, multiple access superposition refers to communicating to multiple users by linearly combining amplitude-weighted, encoded, and/or modulated messages. For example, FIG. 1 has Base Station (BS) 110 (or evolved NodeB (eNB)) and two users (or User Equipments (UEs)), a near UE 120 and a far UE 130 (\u201cnear\u201d and \u201cfar\u201d referring to their relative distances from BS 110). Both the near UE 120 and the far UE 130 receive the same signal x, comprising symbol xn for the near UE 120 and symbol xf for far UE 130, which can be represented by Equation (1): x=\u221a{square root over (\u03b1N)}xN+\u221a{square root over (\u03b1N)}xF (1) where \u03b1 generally refers to transmission power, and thus \u03b1N is the transmission power allocated to the near user signal and \u03b1F is the transmission power allocated to the far user, where \u03b1N+\u03b1F=1. Sometimes \u03b1 refers more generally to the ratio of near user power to far user power, as shown in FIG. 2, which is discussed further below. Speaking simplistically, near UE 120 decodes symbol xf for far UE 130 and uses it to cancel xf as interference, thereby decoding symbol xn intended for the near UE 120. One reiterative process for this type of cancellation is \u201cSuccessive Interference Cancellation\u201d or SIC. The far UE 130, on the other hand, simply decodes its own signal xf. (although it is possible for the far user to also perform some form of signal cancellation to eliminate xn). Generally herein, far user symbol xF corresponds to KF bits of data represented as (d0Fd1F . . . dKF-1F) and near user symbol xN corresponds to KN bits of data represented as (d0Nd1N . . . dKN-1N). FIG. 2 shows an example of a \u201csuper-constellation\u201d formed of a (QPSK, QPSK) modulation pair under MUST. \u201c(QPSK, QPSK)\u201d means that both the far and near UE signals are modulated by QPSK. FIG. 2 is the result of a direct symbol mapping (DSM) of QPSK using Equation (1) for both the near and far users, i.e., a 16-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) super-constellation. Moreover, in FIG. 2, the constituent xf and xn symbols are separately Gray encoded. Each of the four bit symbols in the 16-QAM super-constellation in FIG. 2 comprises two bits for the symbol intended for the far user and two bits of the symbol intended for the near user. More specifically, each four-bit symbol (b0, b1, b2, b3) comprises (b0, b1)=(d0Fd1F), the two bits for the far user, and (b2, b3)=(d0Nd1N), the two bits for the near user. Thus, the far user constellation is relatively coarse, because each quadrant represents only one symbol (for example, the upper right quadrant is (00)), while each quadrant of the near user constellation has all four symbols (00, 01, 10, and 11). However, because the near user is nearer, the near user's received signal is stronger and it will be easier for the near user to distinguish that level of detail than the far user. In theory, having the near user employ Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) by codeword, where the far user codeword is decoded, the original encoded far user codeword reconstructed using the decoded codeword, and then the reconstructed original signal cancelled from the overall signal prior to decoding, is optimal in the sense that it achieves capacity. In practice, Code Word Interference Cancellation (CWIC), as described above, is rather difficult because the near user receiver needs to have the far user's transmission parameters, such as, e.g., the codeword Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), precoding matrix, rank, power boost, etc. If, for example, the network provided this information it would lead to an increase in control signaling overhead. In addition, the decoding, re-constructing, and cancelling of the far user's codeword leads to a substantial usage of resources. By contrast, Symbol-Level Interference Cancellation (SLIC) is a low-complexity approach and when joint detection, i.e., Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection, is used, SLIC can approach the performance of CWIC in many scenarios. However, when SLIC is used, the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) distribution of the different bits in both symbols xN and xF can affect performance. For example, the direct symbol mapping (DSM) leads to degraded SLIC performance. SUMMARY Accordingly, the present disclosure has been made to address at least the problems and/or disadvantages described above and to provide at least the advantages described below. An aspect of the present disclosure provides a new type of superposition super-constellation, the Gray-mapped Non-uniform Constellation (GNC). According to another aspect of the present disclosure, the spacing between neighboring symbols in the GNC super-constellation can be unequal. According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure, the GNC super-constellation is formed by a direct-sum of regularly spaced lattices, which leads to simplified joint LLR generation. According to another aspect of the present disclosure, GNC can be easily extended for MUST with more than two users (i.e., more than simply a \u201cnear\u201d and a \u201cfar\u201d user). According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a method is provided for selecting a superposition constellation including two or more user equipment (UE) constellations, including determining which type of superposition constellation (super-constellation) to generate based at least on a power ratio among the two or more UEs, wherein one type of super-constellation is a Gray-mapped Non-uniform-capable Constellation (GNC), in which both the constituent constellations of the two or more UEs and the GNC super-constellation itself are Gray-mapped; and generating the determined type of superposition constellation. According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a method is provided for a user equipment (UE) in a communication system capable of superposition multiplexing transmission, including receiving an indication that superposition transmission is being used to transmit to the UE; receiving an indication of which type of superposition transmission is being used to transmit to the UE, wherein at least one type of superposition transmission uses a Gray-mapped Non-uniform-capable Constellation (GNC) super-constellation; receiving one or more superposition transmission parameters; and determining a Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) approximation of a received transmission based at least on the type of superposition transmission being used and the one or more superposition transmission parameters. According to one aspect of the present disclosure, an apparatus for selecting a superposition constellation including two or more user equipment (UE) constellations is provided, including at least one non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions capable of execution by a processor; and at least one processor capable of executing instructions stored on the at least one non-transitory computer-readable medium, where the execution of the instructions results in the apparatus performing a method including determining which type of superposition constellation (super-constellation) to generate based at least on a power ratio among the two or more UEs, wherein one type of super-constellation is a Gray-mapped Non-uniform-capable Constellation (GNC), in which both the constituent constellations of the two or more UEs and the GNC super-constellation itself are Gray-mapped; and generating the determined type of superposition constellation. According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a user equipment (UE) is provided, including at least one non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions capable of execution by a processor; and at least one processor capable of executing instructions stored on the at least one non-transitory computer-readable medium, where the execution of the instructions results in the UE performing a method including receiving an indication that superposition transmission is being used to transmit to the UE; receiving an indication of which type of superposition transmission is being used to transmit to the UE, wherein at least one type of superposition transmission uses a Gray-mapped Non-uniform-capable Constellation (GNC) super-constellation; receiving one or more superposition transmission parameters; and determining a Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) approximation of a received transmission based at least on the type of superposition transmission being used and the one or more superposition transmission parameters.

A related non-provisional patent application by the same inventors, entitled Power Allocation on Gray Mapped Superposition Transmission, is being filed concurrently, and claims priority to the same four U.S. provisional patent applications as does the present application. That application is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety. In general, it is preferable for a super-constellation to meet the following three conditions: (1) the super-constellation is Gray encoded/mapped, (2) the balance of transmission power a can be arbitrarily set by the BS/eNB (i.e., having a non-uniform super-constellation, where points are not equidistant); and (3) the constellations making up the super-constellation are themselves individually Gray-encoded (this helps in a situation where the far UE has a signal level close to the I+N floor). The present disclosure describes a new type of super-constellation, a Gray-mapped Non-uniform Constellation (GNC), a super-constellation which is Gray encoded/mapped, allows the BS/eNB to select their own balance of transmission power a among the users (i.e., non-uniform, but still Gray-mapped super-constellations), and ensures the constellations making up the super-constellation are themselves individually Gray-encoded (i.e., in addition to the points of the super-constellation being Gray-mapped). This is discussed in Section I below. Although named \u201cGray-mapped Non-uniform Constellation\u201d (GNC), the term \u201cGNC\u201d covers both non-uniform and uniform super-constellations having the desirable characteristics. As such, \u201cGNC\u201d is sometimes also referred to herein as \u201cGray-mapped Non-uniform-capable Constellation\u201d. GNC is not always the optimal solution. There is an \u201cexclusion\u201d zone where using a GNC super-constellation may provide little or no benefit over other methods of mapping. Moreover, under certain power ratio conditions, better results can be found by \u201cbit-swapping\u201d\u2014reversing the far and near user bits within the GNC\u2014as will be discussed in detail below. Accordingly, another aspect of the present disclosure is to provide methodologies to determine the conditions under which a GNC should be used, when bit-swapping should be used, and when neither is helpful (and other methods may be used). See Sect. II below. Moreover, another aspect of the present disclosure is to provide symbol detector options for MUST in general, and for bit-swapping GNC-based systems in particular. See Sect. III below. Similarly, yet another aspect of the present disclosure is to provide LLR generation/demapping options for MUST in general, and for bit-swapping GNC-based systems in particular. See Sect. IV below. Lastly, control signalling for MUST in general, and for bit-swapping GNC-based systems in particular, are discussed as still another aspect of the present disclosure. See Sect. V below. I. Gray-Mapped Non-Uniform Constellation (GNC) Below, methods for generating a Gray-mapped Non-uniform Constellation (GNC), are discussed, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. Using this new type of bit-to-symbol mapping, Gray-mapping is ensured on both the user and super level, the spacing between symbols can be unequal, and simplified joint LLR generation can be used because the GNC is formed by a direct-sum of regularly spaced lattices. Moreover, GNC can be easily extended to multiple users (i.e., more than simply a \u201cnear\u201d and a \u201cfar\u201d user, as in most of the examples herein). Generally speaking, using the simple example of one near and one far user, where the constellation order of the near user is Nn and the constellation order of the far user is Nf, the super/joint constellation is Ns=Nn*Nf. For a standard uniform Ns-QAM constellation, the real part of the analytical form can be presented as a simplified unit of the repeated nested form, disregarding the factor for power normalization and preceding (1\u22122b0) which is multiplied by the repeating nested structure, as shown in Equation (2): \u2026 \ue89e [ 2 ( log 2 \ue8a0 ( Ns ) 2 - k ) - ( 1 - 2 \ue89e \ue89e b 2 \ue89e \ue89e k ) [ \ue89e \u2026 \ue89e ] ] \ue89e \ue89e where \ue89e \ue89e 1 \u2264 k \u2264 log 2 \ue8a0 ( N f ) 2 - 1. ( 2 ) In a non-uniform Ns-QAM constellation according to embodiments of the present disclosure, new parameters q and p are used to balance the various interests in order to provide the GNC super-constellation, where q guarantees the desired power split between the users and p relates to unit constellation power. One key factor is where to insert the factor of q in the nested structure so as to split the constellation and power between near and far UEs. In an embodiment where the far UE takes the outer bits and near UE takes the inner bits, the q factor should be inserted at the following level in the nested structure as shown in Equation (3) below: \u2026 \ue89e [ 2 log 2 \ue8a0 ( N n ) 2 - q \ue8a0 ( 1 - 2 \ue89e \ue89e b log 2 \ue8a0 ( N s N n ) ) [ \ue89e \u2026 \ue89e ] ] ( 3 ) As mentioned above, new parameter q is designed to maintain Gray mapping in joint/super constellations between two or more UEs in light of the specific power constraints and/or desired power conditions. A specific example is presented in the section below. A. (QPSK, QPSK) Example of a Nested Constellation Structure In this section, a (QPSK,QPSK) modulation pair mapping to a 16-QAM super-constellation, like FIG. 2, will be presented in FIGS. 3A and 3B according to embodiments of the present disclosure. Also like FIG. 2, each four-bit (\u201csuper\u201d)-symbol (b0, b1, b2, b3) comprises two far user bits, (b0, b1)=(d0Fd1F, and two near users bits, (b2, b3)=(d0Nd1N). The mappings in FIGS. 3A and 3B are different from FIG. 2. The far user bits still have the same pattern of values as FIG. 2, with (10) for the upper-left quadrant of the super-constellation, (00) for the upper-right quadrant, (01) for the lower-right quadrant, and (11) for the lower left quadrant. However, near user bits (b2, b8) define Gray labeled constellation points with each set for a given value of the pair (b0, b1). In other words, the pairs of bits (b0, b1) and (b2, b8) form a nested structure where (b0, b1) constitute the \u201couter\u201d part of the direct sum and (b2, b2) form the \u201cinner\u201d part of the direct sum, as shown in Equation (4)(a). ( b 0 , b 1 , b 2 , b 3 ) = ( b 0 , b 1 ) ( outer \ue89e \ue89e part ) \u2295 ( b 2 , b 3 ) ( inner \ue89e \ue89e part ) ( 4 ) \ue89e ( a ) Without loss of generality, \u03b1F>\u03b1N=1\u2212\u03b1F or, equivalently, \u03b1F>0.5 is assumed (generally, it is expected that the larger fraction of power is allocated to the far user in NOMA; if this is not the case, the roles of \u03b1F and \u03b1N can be swapped-so this assumption is not restrictive). Furthermore, the unequal power split can be made part of the symbol mapping process using new parameters q and p as shown in Equations (4)(b) and (4)(c) below: x = 1 C \ue89e { p \ue8a0 ( 1 - 2 \ue89e b 0 ) \ue8a0 [ 2 - q \ue8a0 ( 1 - 2 \ue89e b 2 ) ] + j \ue89e \ue89e p \ue8a0 ( 1 - 2 \ue89e b 1 ) \ue8a0 [ 2 - q \ue8a0 ( 1 - 2 \ue89e b 3 ) ] } ( 4 ) \ue89e ( b ) which is the same as x = 1 C \ue89e { p \ue8a0 ( 1 - 2 \ue89e d 0 F ) \ue8a0 [ 2 - q \ue8a0 ( 1 - 2 \ue89e d 0 N ) ] + j \ue89e \ue89e p \ue8a0 ( 1 - 2 \ue89e d 1 F ) \ue8a0 [ 2 - q \ue8a0 ( 1 - 2 \ue89e d 1 N ) ] } ( 4 ) \ue89e ( c ) where p and q are positive real-valued numbers as discussed above and C is a power constraint value to normalize the power of symbols on the joint constellation map. FIG. 3A shows a (QPSK,QPSK) modulation pair mapping to a 16-QAM super-constellation, using the values of p=0.9354 and q=1.3093, equivalent to \u03b1N=0.3 and \u03b1F=0.7, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The distances between constellation points/symbols are clearly not uniform. While Equations (4)(b)/(c) provide the general mapping formula for a (QPSK,QPSK) modulation pair mapping to a non-uniform 16-QAM super-constellation, they also include a uniform 16-QAM super-constellation according to an embodiment of the present disclosure as a special case. Namely, setting the values p=q=1 or equivalently \u03b1F>0.8 results in a uniform 16-QAM super-constellation with the unique inner/outer qualities according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Accordingly, FIG. 3B shows a (QPSK,QPSK) modulation pair mapping to a 16-QAM super-constellation, using the values of p=1 and q=1, equivalent to \u03b1N=0.2 and \u03b1F=0.8, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In this special case of the more general GNC mapping equations, the distances between constellation points/symbols are uniform. 3GPP RAN1 has established scenarios to evaluate implementations of MUST (i.e., superposition systems). Initially, only two scenarios were used: \u201cScenario 1\u201d, a one-layer or scalar environment and \u201cScenario 2\u201d, a multi-layer environment where a rank 2 precoded signal is transmitted to the near user while a rank 1 slightly differently precoded signal is transmitted to the far user. For more details regarding the scenarios, see, for example, the four U.S. provisional patent applications from which the present application claims priority which have also been expressly incorporated by reference. To meet those scenarios, p and q of the 16-QAM (QPSK,QPSK) super-constellation are subject to certain constraints. For Scenario 1 (scalar/one-layer superposition), the constraints are: 1) 2p2(4+q2)=C which arises from unit constellation power; and 2) q 2 4 = 1 - \u03b1 F \u03b1 F , which arises from the power split requirement between (b0, b1) bits and (b2, b2) bits. For Scenario 2 (two-layer superposition), the constraints are: 1) 2p2(4+q2)=0.5C(1+\u03b1F); and 2) q 2 4 = 1 - \u03b1 F 2 \ue89e \u03b1 F . The constellation that x belongs to is denoted as Sp,q(XQPSK, XQPSK) since it is formed from underlying (QPSK,QPSK) constellations and parameterized by p, q. In the above, p can always be set equal to 1 since it is scaled out by the normalization factor C. Thus, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the nonlinear mapping of the form x=fp,q(x0, x1) is defined, which results in a Gray-mapped Non-uniform Constellation, also known as GNC. A mentioned above, the conventional 16-QAM constellation is a special type of GNC, i.e., when p=q=1. Since selective \u201ccompanding\u201d (i.e., compression and expansion of different sets of constellation points) was applied to a Gray encoded constellation above, it is easy to verify that the bit labeling resulting from Equations (4)(b)/(c) above is also Gray. Any two adjacent symbols of the super-constellation differ by only one bit because the under-lying constellation is Gray encoded. Moreover, as can be seen in FIGS. 3A and 3B, in the four symbols in the center, the near user bits do not change (i.e., they are all \u201c00\u201d) while the far user bits do. This is in contrast with FIG. 2 (i.e., direct symbol mapping), where both the near and far bits in the four center symbols change per symbol. While the (QPSK, QPSK) 16-QAM super-constellation is provided as an example above, additional super-constellations can be generated in the same manner. For example, the specific equations and constraints for the super-constellations shown in Table 1 below are provided in the APPENDIX I appended hereto, as well as in U.S. Prov. Pat. App. Ser. No. 62/173,241 and 62/203,818, from which the present application claims priority (and which have been incorporated by reference in their entirety). TABLE 1 \u201cFar\u201d UE \u201cNear\u201d UE Resulting \u201cSuper- constellation constellation constellation\u201d (2KF)-QAM (2KN)-QAM (2KF+KN)-QAM QPSK QPSK 16QAM 16QAM QPSK 64QAM QPSK 16QAM 64QAM 16QAM 16QAM 256QAM 64QAM QPSK 256QAM QPSK 64QAM 256QAM 64QAM 16QAM 1024QAM 16QAM 64QAM 1024QAM 64QAM 64QAM 4096QAM. B. General Mapping for Arbitrary Constellation Pairs The approach above can be extended to any arbitrary combination of constituent constellations. Like before, the \u201cnear\u201d UE and \u201cfar\u201d UE are inter-changeable. The \u201cfar\u201d user's bits are mapped to the outer part of the resultant constellation and the near user's bits are mapped to the inner part of the resultant constellation. As a result, the bit mapping for (QPSK, 16QAM) is not the same as that for (16QAM,QPSK), for example. When viewed more generally, the outer bits (mapped to the far user in the above example) can be viewed as the \u201cbase layer\u201d and the inner bits (mapped to the near user in the above example) can be viewed as the \u201cextension layer\u201d. (1) General GNC Equation Using M(\u2022) Function Accordingly, the generally-applicable GNC equation can be written as a linear combination of the base layer (xF) and a function of the base layer and extension layer (xN), as set forth in Equation (5): x = p C \ue89e { ax F + q ( M \ue8a0 ( d 0 F \ue89e d 2 F \ue89e \ue89e \u22ef \ue89e \ue89e d K F - 2 F ) \ue89e Re \ue89e { x N } + j \ue89e \ue89e M \ue8a0 ( d 1 F \ue89e d 3 F \ue89e \ue89e \u22ef \ue89e \ue89e d K F - 1 F ) \ue89e Im \ue89e { x N } ) } ( 5 ) where a is a factor that depends on the modulation orders and M(d0Fd2F . . . dKF-2F) and M (d1Fd3F . . . dKF-1F) represent the function M(\u2022) applied to the even and odd bits of the base layer xF respectively. Function M(\u2022) takes only the values of \u22121 and +1. As a result, the I and/or Q values of the extension layer symbol xN undergo sign inversions (equivalent to reflections of the constellation) after the mapping of data bits {d0N . . . dKN-1N} to a (2KN)-QAM constellation prior to transmission. The function M(d0d1 . . . dK-1) is summarized for the different modulation order pairs in Table 2 below.

As shown in FIG. 4, all of the far user bits (d0Fd1F . . . dKF-1F) are input to M-QAM mapper 410, while at the same time the even bits of the far user bits are input into M(*) module 413 and the odd bits of the far user bits are input into M(\u2022) module 415. The M-QAM mapper 410 performs the function of mapping the far user bits, thereby producing the far user signal which is subsequently power scaled by pa C at 450 before being mixed with the near user signal at 460 to produce the GNC symbol output. On the other hand, M(\u2022) module 413 performs the M(\u2022) function on the far user even bits and M(\u2022) module 415 performs the M(\u2022) function on the far user odd bits, which are used in generating the near user signal, as discussed below. All of the near user bits {d0N . . . dKN-1N} are input to M-QAM mapper 420, which, similarly to M-QAM mapper 410, performs the function of mapping the near user bits. The output of M-QAM mapper 420 is input to both the Re(\u2022) module 423, which creates the real part of the signal, and the Im(\u2022) module 425, which creates the imaginary part of the signal. The output of M(\u2022) module 415 is mixed with the output of Im(\u2022) module 425 and the imaginary value j at 435. Similarly, the output of M(\u2022) module 413 is mixed with the output of Re(\u2022) module 423 at 433. Those mixed outputs are themselves mixed at 430 to produce the near user portion of the signal, which undergoes power scaling by being mixed with pq C at 440 before being mixed with the far user signal at 460 to produce the GNC symbol output. The present disclosure is not limited to the linear combination shown in Equation (5) and generated in FIG. 4 but rather can take a number of forms. Accordingly, a signal generation technique and signal generation apparatus according to another embodiment are described below. (2) General GNC Equation Using N(\u2022) Function More specifically, FIG. 5 is a conceptual diagram of a signal generation apparatus using bit-level operations and an N(\u2022) function, where the generally applicable GNC equation for FIG. 5 is written as set forth in Equation (6): x = p C \ue89e { ax F + qx N \u2032 } ( 6 ) where a is a factor that depends on the modulation orders, like in Eq. (5), and x\u2032N is the M-QAM constellation that corresponds to the bit sequence {c0, c1, . . . , cKF-1}, where: {c0,c2, . . . ,cKF-2}={e0\u2295d0N,e0\u2295d2N, . . . ,e0\u2295dKF-2N} (7)(a) {c1,C3, . . . ,cKF-1}={e1\u2295d1N,e1\u2295d3N, . . . ,e1\u2295dKF-1N} (7)(b) and e0=N(d0F,d2F, . . . ,dKF-2F) (8)(a) e1=N(d1F,d3F, . . . ,dKF-1F) (8)(b) The N(\u2022) function takes only the binary values of 0 and 1 and the function N(d0d1 . . . dK-1) is summarized for the different modulation order pairs in Table 3 below.

As shown in FIG. 5, all of the far user bits (d0Fd1F . . . dKF-1F) are input to M-QAM mapper 510, while at the same time the even bits in the far user bits are input into N(module 513 and the odd bits in the far user bits are input into N(\u2022) module 515. The M-QAM mapper 510 performs the function of mapping the far user bits, thereby producing the far user signal which is subsequently power scaled by pa C at 550 before being mixed with the near user signal at 560 to produce the GNC symbol output. On the other hand, N(module 513 performs the N(\u2022) function on the far user even bits, producing e0, and N(\u2022) module 515 performs the N(function on the far user odd bits, thereby producing e1, which are used in generating the near user signal, as discussed below. On the other hand, the near user bits {d0N . . . dKN-1N} are split into its even bits, which are input to Bit XOR module 522, and its odd bits, which are input to Bit XOR module 524. Bit XOR module 522 and Bit XOR module 524 also receive e0, and e1 as input from N(\u2022) module 513 and N(\u2022) module 515, respectively. Thus, Bit XOR module 522 performs the XOR operation on the even near user bits and e0 and Bit XOR module 524 performs the XOR operation on the even near user bits and e1. The even XOR'd bits from Bit XOR module 522 and the odd XOR'd bits from Bit XOR module 524 are both input into M-QAM mapper 520, which converts the series of both even and odd bits to a QAM symbol. The output of M-QAM mapper 520, comprising X\u2032N, undergoes power scaling by being mixed with pq C at 540 before being mixed with the far user signal at 560 to produce the GNC symbol output. C. Extension to More than Two Users In yet another related embodiment of the present disclosure, the Gray mapping method can be extended to more than two users, i.e., a K-user system. Information symbols of K users can be linearly superposed to yield Equation (9): x=\u221a{square root over (\u03b10)}x0+\u221a{square root over (\u03b11)}x1+ . . . +\u221a{square root over (\u03b1K-1)}xK-1 (9) where xj is the M-QAM symbol for the j-th user such that \u03b1j>0 and the constraint \u03b10+\u03b11+ . . . +\u03b1K-1=1 holds. When, for example, the K=2, the signal received at a given user's receiver can be written as Equation (10) below: y=h(\u221a{square root over (\u03b1N)}x0+\u221a{square root over (\u03b1F)}x1) (10) where y=[y0, . . . , ynR-1]T is a nR\u00d71 receive signal vector, h is the nR\u00d71 channel vector (which includes precoding at the eNB, if any), and n is the vector that models additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) which has the distribution CN(0,\u03b1n2l). The bits for the K users can be mapped as a super-constellation from outermost bits to innermost bits of the super-constellation. The super-constellation is Gray encoded when some conditions on \u03b1j are satisfied. For example, if all K users have QPSK as their single-user constellations, the mapping can be written as Equation (11): (b0,b1,b2,b3, . . . ,b2k-2,b2K-2)=(b0,b1)\u2295(b2,b3) . . . \u2295(b2K-2,b2K-1) (11) leading to a (22K)-QAM super-constellation. For example, for K=3, this approach leads to bits-to-symbol mapping defined by Equation (12): x = 1 C \ue89e { ( 1 - 2 \ue89e d 0 ( 0 ) ) \ue89e p [ 4 - q \ue8a0 ( 1 - 2 \ue89e d 0 ( 1 ) ) \ue8a0 [ 2 - r \ue8a0 ( 1 - 2 \ue89e d 0 ( 2 ) ) ] ] + j \ue8a0 ( 1 - 2 \ue89e d 1 ( 0 ) ) \ue89e p [ 4 - q \ue8a0 ( 1 - 2 \ue89e d 1 ( 1 ) ) \ue8a0 [ 2 - r \ue8a0 ( 1 - 2 \ue89e d 3 ( 2 ) ) ] ] } ( 12 ) where (d0(j)d1(j)) refers to the bits of the j-th user, and p, q, and r are positive real-valued numbers which, in Equation (12), are subject to the constraint indicated by Equation (13): 2p2(16+4q2+q2r2)=C (13) It is trivial to extend the above to the case of arbitrary combinations of modulation orders for the K users. As shown above, a new type of bit-to-symbol mapping produces a new type of super-constellation, the Gray-mapped Non-uniform Constellation, or Gray-mapped Non-uniform-capable Constellation, (GNC). Several methods for providing such mapping are described and it is shown that it can be extended to any arbitrary number of users (i.e., more than simply a \u201cnear\u201d and a \u201cfar\u201d user). II. Adaptive Scheduling/Mapping Using GNC A. Adaptive Bit Swapping to Maintain Gray Mapping According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, adaptive bit mapping can be used to maintain Gray mapping, irrespective of the relative powers of the far user and the near user. In the GNC mapping described above, certain conditions need to be maintained. For example, in order for Gray mapping to be maintained in a (QPSK, QPSK) super-constellation, the condition q<2 needs to be satisfied. The same condition needs to be met for (16QAM, QPSK) and (64QAM, QPSK) super-constellations. Similarly, the condition 3q<4 needs to be satisfied for the (QPSK, 16QAM) and (16QAM, 16QAM) super-constellations. For (QPSK, 64QAM), the condition 7q<8 needs to be satisfied. Accordingly, the power ratio \u03b1 N \u03b1 F = 1 - \u03b1 F \u03b1 F < T for Scenario 1 and the power ratio \u03b1 N \ue89e / \ue89e 2 \u03b1 F = 1 - \u03b1 F \u03b1 F < T for Scenario 2 must be satisfied for the values of T given by Table 4 below. TABLE 4 Necessary Conditions for Maintenance of Gray Mapping (far, near) Modulation pair T (QPSK, QPSK) 1 (16-QAM, QPSK) 1/5 (QPSK, 16-QAM) 5/9 (16-QAM, 16-QAM) 1/9 (64-QAM, QPSK) 1/21 (QPSK, 64-QAM) 3/7 (64-QAM, 16-QAM) TBD (16-QAM, 64-QAM) TBD (64-QAM, 64-QAM) TBD When the above power ratio conditions are not met, direct mapping leads to a non-Gray mapping. However, Gray mapping is still possible, if the roles of the near and far users are swapped, i.e., the outer bits can be assigned to the near user and the inner bits can be assigned to the far user, leading to near user bits (b0, b1 . . . )=(d0N, d1N, . . . ) and far user bits (b2k, b2k+1, . . . )=(d0F, d1F, . . . ) TABLE 5 GNC Exclusion Region for Gray Mapping based on \u03b1 N \u03b1 F ratio (far, near) Modulation pair Scenario 1 Scenario 2 (QPSK, QPSK) null set null set (16-QAM, QPSK) (1/5, 9/5) (2/5, 18/5) (QPSK, 16-QAM) (5/9, 5) (10/9, 10) (16-QAM, 16QAM) (1/9, 9) (2/9, 18) (64-QAM, QPSK) (1/21, 7/3) (2/21, 14/3) (QPSK, 64-QAM) (3/7, 21) (6/7, 42) (64-QAM, 16-QAM) TBD TBD (16-QAM, 64-QAM) TBD TBD (64-QAM, 64-QAM) TBD TBD The above condition can be equivalently written as: \u03b1F>T1 (Gray mapping without bit swapping) \u03b1F<T2 (Gray mapping with swapping) The exclusion region is defined with respect to \u03b1F as (T1, T2), for suitable real numbers T1, T2 such that 0<T2<T1<1. When the conditions for Gray mapping are not met due to power allocation at the scheduler, there are two options: Option 1: Maintain GNC mapping Option 2: Fall back to direct symbol mapping Even when the conditions for Gray mapping are violated, there are certain scenarios (certain pairs of MCS and power ratio) where GNC outperforms DSM. In this embodiment, Gray mapping is used whenever feasible, by adaptively selecting GNC or DSM as follows: if \u03b1F>t0 use GNC with no swapping and mapping far user bits to outer bits and if \u03b1F<t1 use GNC with bit swapping and mapping far user bits to inner bits, if t1<\u03b1F<t0, use DSM where t0 and t1 are two thresholds, such that t1\u2266t0. The thresholds t0 and t1 need to be selected based on the MCS pair being used for the two users. For many constellation pairs (lower order QAM), either GNC without swapping or GNC with swapping is better than DSM for any aF, thus, t0=t1. For other constellation pairs (mainly higher order QAM), there is a small region within t1<aF<t0 where DSM outperforms GNC. There may also be some benefit in transitioning to bit swapping either a \u201clittle early\u201d as, for example, \u03b1F increases for trading off far user performance for near user performance, or a \u201clittle late\u201d, as, for example, an increases for trading off near SNR for far user SNR. For example, for (QPSK, QPSK) a threshold may be chosen to be slightly smaller than for 1 (instead of exactly 1) for bit swapping. As another example, for (QPSK, QPSK) a threshold to t0 be smaller that 0.5 (instead of exactly 0.5) for bit swapping. The thresholds can be modified based on the user MCS selected. In addition to the relative powers allocated by the scheduler for the near user and the far user and the user rank, the near user MCS and the far user MCS also need to be taken into account in order to determine whether the outer bits should be mapped to the far user or the near user. Bit swapping leads to a different minimum distance for near (far) user symbols compared to no swapping. Accordingly, the target Block Error Rate (BLER) is a function of both the bit mapping order (i.e., no swapping vs. bit swapping) and the relative power allocation for the two users (and additionally the transmission rank for the two users). In general, the scheduler needs to determine the target rates achievable for both no-swapping and bit-swapping options based on the minimum distance (for near and far user symbols in the super-constellation) achieved with either option. The largest MCS pair that can achieve a certain target BLER level with no-swapping may be different from the largest MCS pair that can achieve the same target BLER level with bit-swapping. Accordingly, the scheduler needs to jointly perform: 1. user pair selection, 2. decision to transmit using MUST vs. use single user transmission on an RB or set of RBs 3. MUST transmission configuration a. transmission rank b. power split among users/power split selection c. user MCS pair for MUST, d. selection of (i) GNC w/swap; (ii) GNC w/o swap; and (iii) DSM. The selection can be made jointly in order to maximize weighted sum rate, packet flow (PF) metric, and other parameters at the scheduler. Therefore, the bit-swapping criterion can be formulated as any one of the options below, i.e., bit-swapping is performed if any one of Equations (14)(i) through (14)(v) is met: f 1 \ue8a0 ( \u03b1 N , \u03b1 F , r N , r F , MCS N , MCS F ) < T 1 ( 14 ) \ue89e ( i ) f 2 \ue8a0 ( \u03b1 N , \u03b1 F , r N , r F , MCS N , MCS F ) < T 2 \ue8a0 ( m N , m F ) ( 14 ) \ue89e ( ii ) f 3 ( \u03b1 N \u03b1 F , r N , r F , MCS N , MCS F ) < T 2 \ue8a0 ( m N , m F ) ( 14 ) \ue89e ( iii ) f 4 ( \u03b1 N \u03b1 F , MCS N , MCS F ) < T 3 \ue8a0 ( m N , m F , r N , r F ) ( 14 ) \ue89e ( iv ) f 5 ( \u03b1 N \u03b1 F ) < T 4 \ue8a0 ( m N , m F , r N , r F , MCS N , MCS F ) ( 14 ) \ue89e ( v ) Here: f1, f2, f3, f4, f5 are various mapping functions; T1 is a threshold; T2, T3 and T4 are threshold functions; MCSN, MCSF are MCSs for the near user and far user respectively (this implicitly includes modulation information); mN, mF are modulation orders for the near user and far user respectively (these are dependent on the selected MCSN, MCSF; and rN, rP are transmission ranks for the near user and far user respectively. When a GNC scheme is used, the \u201cno-swapping\u201d vs. \u201cbit-swapping\u201d selection problem is a part of the scheduler implementation where the scheduler jointly performs user selection and MUST vs. no MUST selection, and if MUST is employed, the scheduler performs user MCS pair, rank, and power split selection. If either user has a rank 2 transmission, the user MCS can be replaced with the user MCS pair for the two layers. For example, for Scenario 2, MCSN can be replaced with the pair (MCSN,1, MCSN,2) which denotes the MCS for the two layers in the above-described threshold criteria. FIG. 6A is a flowchart illustrating the process of selecting and generating super-constellations according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. FIG. 6A is a simplistic representation of the main operations and factors involved. In 610A, the parameters used to make the following decisions are received, collected, and/or generated, such as, for example, the a power ratio. In 620A, the type of super-constellation to use is determined, based on the parameters of 610A. Finally, in 630A, the bits of the K users are mapped to the super-constellation of the determined type. FIG. 6B is a flowchart illustrating decision logic involved in the processes of scheduling, mapping, and modulation, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In other words, FIG. 6B fills in some of the details and examples involved in an implementation of FIG. 6A. FIG. 6B is a simplistic representation of what would be implemented as a number of interacting processes and subroutines and is being used for purposes of explanation only. In 610B, data needed to make the following decisions are received, including, but not limited to, one or more of the \u03b1N/\u03b1F power ratio, the far user MCS, the near user MCS, the far user Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) rank, the near user MIMO rank, target BLER, target throughput, and similar possibly pertinent parameters, as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In 620B, the selection, based at least in part on the data received in 610A, is made among: GNC with no swapping; GNC with swapping; and DSM. The scheduler/modulation mapper determines whether the criterion passes based on the received elements. When the criterion passes, the scheduler/modulation mapper maps outer bits to the far user and maps inner bits to the near user. When the criterion does not pass, the scheduler/modulation mapper maps outer bits to the near user and maps inner bits to the far user. If GNC with no swapping is selected in 620B, the outer bits are mapped to the far user: (b0, b1, . . . )=(d0F, d1F, . . . ), and the inner bits are mapped to the near user: (b2K, b2K+1, . . . )=(d0N, d1N, . . . ), i.e., no bit swapping, in 630B-\u03b1. If GNC with swapping is selected in 620B, the inner bits are mapped to the far user: (b2K, b2K+1, . . . )=(d0F, d1F, . . . ), and the outer bits are mapped to the near user: (b0, b1, . . . )=(d0N, d1N, . . . ), i.e., the far and near bits have swapped inner-outer, in 630B-\u03b2. If DSM is selected in 620B, the far user's bits (d0F, d1F, . . . ) and the near user's bits (d0N, d1N, . . . ) are directly mapped in 630B-\u03b3. When the bits are swapped before transmission, three detectors are feasible, as set forth below. 1) Full joint LLR generation\u2014for this option, either Log-MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) (best performance) or Max-Log-MAP can be used to generate LLRs for both near and far user bits; 2) Perform hard slicing of the near user first treating the far user as noise, then symbol SIC to remove the near user interference, and then generate far user LLR; and 3) Treating the near user as noise and perform SU detection on far user data. While the third option is simplest, it will have poor performance. The first option has the best performance but involves determining an LLR for the bits of the super-constellation. III. MUST Detector There are several symbol detector options for MUST. For joint demapping, both xF and xN are jointly demapped by both far and near UEs (i.e., independent of the UE near/far condition). The UE will need to implement up to 4096-QAM soft demapper even if only {QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM} are allowed as the single-user constellations. Details for soft demapping of non-uniform M-QAM constellation (M<=4096) are described in greater detail below. The rank 1 (rk1) Log-MAP (direct method or using rk2 LM) approach can be used for this case. The UE will need to implement up to 65,536-QAM soft demapper if {QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, 256-QAM} are all allowed as single-user constellations. The rk2 DL-LM approach is used for computing LLR. Further details on rk2 LM with SIC or turbo-detection/decoding (Turbo-DD) when feasible for the non-uniform constellation are described in greater detail below. For Hybrid SU detection and SIC based on a UE near/far condition, the near UE detects both xF and xN. The UE uses successive interference cancellation (SIC) where xF is first detected (treating xN as noise) and cancelled followed by detection of xN. The far UE always performs SU detection of xF (treating xN as noise). A UE determines if it is a near UE or a far UE based on measurements, e.g., reference signal received quality (RSRQ) or reference signal received power (RSRP) levels, or some other control information. This hybrid SU detection option outperforms joint demapping. As mentioned above, there are three (3) options for lower complexity far user detection. The first option is the conventional detector and decoding. The near user is treated as noise and SU detection is performed on far user data. Although it is the simplest, the first option has poor performance as the near user maps to outer bits, which is highly non-Gaussian. The second option is Symbol-level IC (SLIC). The second option is a feasible option. For full joint LLR generation, either Log-MAP (best performance) or Max-Log-MAP can be used to generate LLRs for both near and far user bits. Hard slicing of the near user is performed first treating the far user as noise. Symbol SIC is then performed to remove near user interference and then generate far user LLR. The third option is CW-level IC (CWIC). Generally, the near user MCS is expected to be high and the SINR conditions at the far user may be insufficient to decode the near user CW even with side information. Thus, CWIC is likely infeasible. The different detector options for near and far users are described in greater detail below. A. Scalar/1-Layer Superposition With respect to scalar or 1-layer superposition, the received signal can be written as Equation (15): y=h(\u221a{square root over (\u03b1)}x0+\u221a{square root over (1\u2212\u03b1)}x\u20320)+n (15) where y=[y0, . . . , ynR-1]T is a nR\u00d71 receive signal vector, x0 belongs to (2K1)-QAM constellation which is the data symbol of interest and x\u20320 belongs to (2K2)-QAM constellation which is the data symbol for the co-scheduled UE, \u03b1 is the power allocation value such that 0<\u03b1<1, and h is the nR\u00d71 channel vector (which includes precoding at the eNB, if any). The log-likelihood ratio (LLR) for b0,1, the l-th bit of x0 (where 0<l<K1), is the Log-MAP (LM) as shown in Equation (16) below: l \ue8a0 ( b 0 , l ) = log \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( b 0 , l = 0 \ue89e \ue85c \ue89e y ) P \ue8a0 ( b 0 , l = 1 \ue89e \ue85c \ue89e y ) = log \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( y \ue89e \ue85c \ue89e b 0 , l = 0 ) \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( b 0 , l = 0 ) P \ue8a0 ( y \ue89e \ue85c \ue89e b 0 , l = 1 ) \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( b 0 , l = 1 ) = log \ue89e \u2211 x 0 : b i , l = 0 \ue89e \u2211 x o \u2032 \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( y \ue89e \ue85c \ue89e x 0 , x 1 ) \u2211 x 0 : b i , l = 1 \ue89e \u2211 x o \u2032 \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( y \ue89e \ue85c \ue89e x 0 , x 1 ) = log \ue89e \u2211 x 0 : b i , l = 0 \ue89e \u2211 x o \u2032 \ue89e \uf74d \uf605 y - h ( \u03b1 \ue89e x o + 1 - \u03b1 \ue89e x o \u2032 \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 \u2211 x 0 : b i , l = 1 \ue89e \u2211 x o \u2032 \ue89e \uf74d \uf605 y - h ( \u03b1 \ue89e x o + 1 - \u03b1 \ue89e x o \u2032 \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 ( 16 ) In the first approach, LLRs are obtained for the bits of the symbol x=\u221a{square root over (\u03b1)}x0+\u221a{square root over (1\u2212\u03b1)}x\u20320 using the joint soft-demapper as described below. As an alternative approach, Max-Log-MAP approximation may be applied for one of the dimensions to get Equation (17) below: L \ue8a0 ( b 0 , l ) = log \ue89e \u03a3 x 0 \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b i , l = 0 \ue89e max x 0 \u2032 \ue89e \ue89e \uf74d - \uf605 y - h \ue8a0 ( \u03b1 \ue89e x 0 + 1 - \u03b1 \ue89e x 0 \u2032 ) \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 \u03a3 x 0 \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b i , l = 1 \ue89e max x 0 \u2032 \ue89e \uf74d - \uf605 y - h \ue8a0 ( \u03b1 \ue89e x 0 + 1 - \u03b1 \ue89e x 0 \u2032 ) \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 ( 17 ) This is identical to 2-layer transmission with effective (rank 1) channel matrix [\u221a{square root over (\u03b1)}h, \u221a{square root over (1\u2212\u03b1)}h]. Thus, an Rk 2 detector may be used for optimal or suboptimal symbol detection for 1-layer MUST transmission in the absence of a priori information. If a priori information is available, the Rk2 LM approach can be used. To summarize, two approaches are possible for detection of scalar or 1-layer superposition transmission: Use joint soft-demapper to obtain LLRs for the bits of the symbol x=\u221a{square root over (\u03b1)}x0+\u221a{square root over (1\u2212\u03b1)}x\u20320. Use rk2 LM with SIC or Turbo-DD if feasible approach assuming effective (rank 1) channel matrix [\u221a{square root over (\u03b1)}h, \u221a{square root over (1\u2212\u03b1)}h]. Both the near UE and the far UE can adopt the above methods (the latter option without SIC or Turbo-DD) if the modulation for the other user and the power split information are both known. In addition to the modulation order for the other user if MCS and radio network temporary identifier (RNTI) information for the other user are known, it is possible for example for the near user to first obtain LLR for the far user, decode the far user CW and perform SIC to cancel the far user signal from the received signal. After this, the receiver can generate LLR for the near user symbols and perform decoding of the near user CW. In MUST context, this forms the CodeWord Interference Cancellation (CWIC) method. B. Multi-Layer Superposition With respect to multi-layer superposition, the received signal can be written as Equation (18): y=v1(\u03b1x0+\u03b2x\u20320)+v2x1+n (18) Suppose that x0 belongs to (2K1)-QAM constellation and x1 belongs to (2K2)-QAM constellation, which are the two data symbols of interest, and x\u20320 belongs to (2K3)-QAM constellation which is the data symbol for the co-scheduled UE. The LLR for b0,1, the l-th bit of x0 (where 0<l<K1), is the Log-MAP (LM) as shown in Equation (19) below: L \ue8a0 ( b 0 , l ) = \ue89e log \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( b 0 , l = 0 \ue85c y ) P \ue8a0 ( b 0 , l = 1 \ue85c y ) = \ue89e log \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( y \ue85c b 0 , l = 0 ) \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( b 0 , l = 0 ) P \ue8a0 ( y \ue85c b 0 , l = 1 ) \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( b 0 , l = 1 ) = \ue89e log \ue89e \u03a3 x 0 \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b i , l = 0 \ue89e \u03a3 x 1 \ue89e \u03a3 x 0 \u2032 \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( y \ue85c x 0 , x 1 , x 0 \u2032 ) \u03a3 x 0 \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b i , l = 1 \ue89e \u03a3 x 1 \ue89e \u03a3 x 0 \u2032 \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( y \ue85c x 0 , x 1 , x 0 \u2032 ) = \ue89e log \ue89e \u03a3 x 0 \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b i , l = 0 \ue89e \u03a3 x 1 \ue89e \u03a3 x 0 \u2032 \ue89e \uf74d - \uf605 y - v 1 \ue8a0 ( \u03b1 \ue89e \ue89e x 0 + \u03b2 \ue89e \ue89e x 0 \u2032 ) + v 2 \ue89e x 1 \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 \u03a3 x 0 \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b i , l = 1 \ue89e \u03a3 x 1 \ue89e \u03a3 x 0 \u2032 \ue89e \uf74d - \uf605 y - v 1 \ue8a0 ( \u03b1 \ue89e \ue89e x 0 + \u03b2 \ue89e \ue89e x 0 \u2032 ) + v 2 \ue89e x 1 \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 ( 19 ) In the first approach, rk2LM (with SIC or Turbo-DD if feasible) approach is used, as follows: Treat [v1, V2] as the effective rank 2 channel; obtain LLRs for the bits of symbol x1 (which belongs to the legacy M-QAM constellation); obtain LLRs for the bits of the symbol x=\u03b1x0+\u03b2x\u20320, using the joint soft-demapper. For this case, the rk2 LM approach needs to be extended as shown below. As an alternative, rk3/rk4 MIMO detector could be used by treating [\u03b1v1, \u03b2v1, v2x1] as the effective channel matrix and assuming a 3-layer transmission. However, the rank of this effective channel is 2 since two of the columns are linearly dependent. As a result, the rk3 MMSE step to find the initial candidate x0, etc., fails, at least at high SNR. On the other hand, rk3 lattice search methods can potentially be employed for obtaining LLRs of bits of x0, x1, and x\u20320. To summarize, two approaches are possible for detection of multi-layer superposition transmission: Use rk2 LM (with SIC or Turbo-DD if feasible) approach by obtaining LLRs for the bits of the symbol X=\u03b1x0+\u03b2x\u20320 using the joint soft-demapper. Use rk3 lattice search methods for obtaining LLRs of bits of x0, x1, and x\u20320. The above SLIC methods can be used by both the near UE and the far UE if the receiver knows the other user's modulation order and the power split information. The near UE can perform CWIC to cancel far user CW prior to decoding its own CW if the MCS and RNTI information for the far user are known. IV. LLR Generation for Receiving GNC Symbols The constellation generated by the mapping above leads to a non-uniform constellation since the constellation points are on an unequally spaced lattice. However, one property of the mapping is that the underlying direct-sum constellation is a (2KF+KN)-QAM constellation, albeit with non-uniform symbol boundaries. Therefore, the LLR computation logic may be extended for a Gray-encoded (2KF+KN)-QAM constellation by modifying the decision boundaries. LLR generation for the m-th bit of the symbol in the non-uniform (2KF+KN)-QAM constellation is described. Since the LLR is generated jointly, whether this bit belongs to the near user or far user (i.e., desired user or co-scheduled user), can be ignored for the time being. A. SISO/SIMO Soft Demapper Using Max-Log-MAP Approximation With respect to SISO/SIMO soft demapper using MLM approximation, common variables ycb, CSIcb, I and Q can be defined as set forth below in Equations (20)(a) and (20)(b). y cb = h H \ue89e y C = 1 C \ue89e \u2211 j = 0 n R - 1 \ue89e h j * \ue89e y j , CSI cb = \uf603 h C \uf604 2 ( 20 ) \ue89e ( a ) I = Re ( y cb ) , Q = Im \ue8a0 ( y cb ) ( 20 ) \ue89e ( b ) The unnormalized symbol can be defined as set forth in Equation (21) below: {dot over (x)}=\u221a{square root over (C)}x (21) The LLR for bit m (ignoring whether this bit belongs to the near user or far user) using max-log-MAP approximation can be defined as set forth below in Equation (22). L A \ue8a0 ( b m ) = - min x \u2208 X m + \ue89e \uf603 y cb - CSI cb \ue89e x . \uf604 2 CSI cb \ue89e \u03c3 n 2 + min x \u2208 X m - \ue89e \uf603 y cb - CSI cb \ue89e x . \uf604 2 CSI cb \ue89e \u03c3 n 2 ( 22 ) As compared to the uniform constellation case, the constant C is no longer fixed but rather is a function of the modulation pair and parameters p and q. The symbol X\u03b5Sp,q (\u03c71, \u03c72) belongs to a non-uniform constellation formed by the constellation pair (\u03c71, \u03c72). For even values of m, LLR only depends on I, as shown in Equation (23)(a) below, and for odd values of m, LLR only depends on Q, as shown in Equation (23)(b) below: \u2032 \ue89e I = 1 C \ue89e ( \uf603 h \uf604 2 \ue89e x I + Re \ue8a0 ( h H \ue89e n ) ) ( 23 ) \ue89e ( a ) \u2032 \ue89e Q = 1 C \ue89e ( \uf603 h \uf604 2 \ue89e x Q + Im \ue8a0 ( h H \ue89e n ) ( 23 ) \ue89e ( b ) By defining a = CSI cb \ue89e \ue89e and \ue89e \ue89e L A \ue8a0 ( b m ) \u2032 = \u03c3 n 2 4 \ue89e L A \ue8a0 ( b m ) , Equation (22) can be rewritten as Equation (24): L A \u2032 \ue8a0 ( b m ) = \ue89e \u03c3 n 2 4 \ue89e ( - min x \u2208 X m + \ue89e ( I - a \ue89e x . l ) 2 a \ue89e \ue89e \u03c3 n 2 + min x \u2208 X m - \ue89e ( I - a \ue89e x . l ) 2 a \ue89e \ue89e \u03c3 n 2 ) = \ue89e - min x \u2208 X m + \ue89e ( I - a \ue89e x . l ) 2 4 \ue89e a + min x \u2208 X m - \ue89e ( I - a \ue89e x . l ) 2 4 \ue89e a ( 24 ) where \u03c7mt denotes the subset of Sp,q(\u03c71, \u03c72), such that the m-th bit of each element in the subset is equal to \u20180\u2019; and \u03c7m\u2212 denotes the subset of Sp,q(\u03c71, \u03c72) such that the m-th bit of each element in the subset is equal to \u20181\u2019. Using this framework, decision boundaries and LLR values can be calculated for SISO/SIMO soft demapping using MLM approximation. The decision boundaries for different bits correspond to a Gray-mapped super-constellation if power allocation satisfies the necessary conditions for maintenance of Gray mapping. See, e.g., Tables 4 and 5 above. For different modulation order pairs, Max-Log-MAP soft demapper expressions can be derived under the assumption that Gray mapping is maintained (with or without bit swapping). Examples of specific equations, LLR values, and decision boundaries for GNC super-constellations in a rk1 SISO/SIMO transmission are provided in APPENDIX II attached hereto, and in U.S. Prov. Pat. App. Ser. No. 62/173,241 and 62/203,818, from which APPENDIX II is derived and the present application claims priority (and which have been incorporated by reference in their entirety). In another embodiment of the present disclosure, it is shown that the LLR for bit b, based on max-log-MAP approximation for the approach proposed earlier can be written down in the general form of Equations (25)(a) and (b): L\u2032A(bl)=g(p,q)Re(vcb)+h(p,q) for l even (25)(a) L\u2032A(bl)=g(p,q)Im(ycb)+h(p,q) for l odd (25)(b) where g(p,q) and h(p,q) are two functions of parameters p,q, and: y cb = h H \ue89e y C = 1 C \ue89e \u2211 j = 0 n R - 1 \ue89e h \ue89e j ^ \ue89e y j ( 26 ) Equation (26) is determined based on the received signal vector and the estimated channel state. B. SISO/SIMO Rank 1 Direct Soft Demapping Using Log-MAP With respect to rank 1 Log-MAP for SISO/SIMO, a simplification is used; namely, that the number of Euclidean Distances (ED) required for calculating LLR for all of the bits of GNC symbol is equal to 2(KF+KN)/2+1 or 2\u221a{square root over (M)}, where M=2KF+KN. Assuming that simplification, the LLR for bit bm in GNC can be written as Equation (27): L \ue8a0 ( b m ) = \ue89e log \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( b m = 0 \ue85c y ) P \ue8a0 ( b m = 1 \ue85c y ) = \ue89e log \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( y \ue85c b m = 0 ) \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( b m = 0 ) P \ue8a0 ( y \ue85c b m = 1 ) \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( b m = 1 ) = \ue89e log \ue89e \u03a3 x \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b m = 0 \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( y \ue85c x ) \u03a3 x \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b m = 1 \ue89e P \ue8a0 ( y \ue85c x ) = \ue89e log \ue89e \u03a3 x \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b m = 0 \ue89e \uf74d - \uf605 y - hx \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 \u03a3 x \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b m = 1 \ue89e \uf74d - \uf605 y - hx \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 ( 27 ) where x\u03b5Sp,q(\u03c71, \u03c72), \u03c71 is the first user's constellation, and \u03c72 is second user's constellation. Let Sp,qI (\u03c71, \u03c72) denote the real-valued set formed by projection of the constellation symbols of Sp,q(\u03c71, \u03c72) on the I-axis and Sp,qQ(\u03c71, \u03c72) denote the real-valued set (ignoring the \u221a{square root over (\u22121)} term) formed by projection of the constellation symbols of Sp,q(\u03c71, \u03c72) on the Q-axis. Thus, for example, if \u03c71=\u03c7QPSK and \u03c72=\u03c716QAM, then: S p , q I \ue8a0 ( \u03c7 1 , \u03c7 2 ) = \ue89e S p , q Q \ue8a0 ( \u03c7 1 , \u03c7 2 ) = \ue89e { - 4 \ue89e p - 3 \ue89e pq , - 4 \ue89e p - pq , - 4 \ue89e p + pq , \ue89e - 4 \ue89e p + 3 \ue89e pq , 4 \ue89e p - 3 \ue89e pq , 4 \ue89e p - pq , \ue89e 4 \ue89e p + pq , 4 \ue89e p + 3 \ue89e pq } ( 28 ) Equation (29) below holds for SISO/SIMO: \uf605 y - hx \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 = 1 \u03c3 2 \ue8a0 [ \uf605 y \uf606 2 - 1 h H \ue89e h \ue89e ( h H \ue89e y ) 2 ] + 1 \u03c3 2 \ue89e h H \ue89e h \ue89e \uf605 h H \ue89e y - ( h H \ue89e h ) \ue89e x \uf606 2 ( 29 ) The first term on the right in the preceding equation ( 1 \u03c3 2 \ue8a0 [ \uf605 y \uf606 2 - 1 h H \ue89e h \ue89e ( h H \ue89e y ) 2 ] ) does not depend on x. Using the symmetry of constellation points around the I-axis for the set {x: bm=0} and the set {x: bm=1} for even m, then for even indexed m: log \ue89e \u03a3 x \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b m = 0 \ue89e \uf74d - \uf605 y - hx \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 \u03a3 x \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b m = 1 \ue89e \uf74d - \uf605 y - hx \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 = log \ue89e \u03a3 z \u2208 S p . q I \ue8a0 ( X 1 , X 2 ) \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b m = 0 \ue89e \uf74d - \uf605 Re \ue89e { h H \ue89e y } - ( h H \ue89e h ) \ue89e z \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 \u03a3 z \u2208 S p . q I \ue8a0 ( X 1 , X 2 ) \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b m = 1 \ue89e \uf74d - \uf605 Re \ue89e { h H \ue89e y } - ( h H \ue89e h ) \ue89e z \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 ( 30 ) The same simplification and calculation can be made for odd-indexed m. See Eq. (31)(b) below. The set {x: bm=0} has M/2 elements where M=2KF+KN. Therefore, when using the brute force approach, M Euclidean Distances (ED) would need to be computed to find the LLRs. However, the set {z\u03b5Sp,qI(\u03c71, \u03c72): bm=0} has only \u221a{square root over (M)} elements. Accordingly, using the simplification above according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, only 2\u221a{square root over (M)} EDs would need to be computed in order to calculate LLRs for all of the bits of a GNC symbol. To summarize, the LLRs for rk1 GNC transmission can be computed as Equations (31)(a) and (31)(b) below. L \ue8a0 ( b m ) = log \ue89e \u03a3 z \u2208 S p . q I \ue8a0 ( X 1 , X 2 ) \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b m = 0 \ue89e \uf74d - \uf605 Re \ue89e { h H \ue89e y } - ( h H \ue89e h ) \ue89e z \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 \u03a3 z \u2208 S p . q I \ue8a0 ( X 1 , X 2 ) \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b m = 1 \ue89e \uf74d - \uf605 Re \ue89e { h H \ue89e y } - ( h H \ue89e h ) \ue89e z \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 \ue89e \ue89e for \ue89e \ue89e even \ue89e \ue89e m ( 31 ) \ue89e ( a ) L \ue8a0 ( b m ) = log \ue89e \u03a3 z \u2208 S p . q Q \ue8a0 ( X 1 , X 2 ) \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b m = 0 \ue89e \uf74d - \uf605 Im \ue89e { h H \ue89e y } - ( h H \ue89e h ) \ue89e z \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 \u03a3 z \u2208 S p . q Q \ue8a0 ( X 1 , X 2 ) \ue89e : \ue89e \ue89e b m = 1 \ue89e \uf74d - \uf605 Im \ue89e { h H \ue89e y } - ( h H \ue89e h ) \ue89e z \uf606 2 \u03c3 2 \ue89e \ue89e for \ue89e \ue89e odd \ue89e \ue89e m ( 31 ) \ue89e ( b ) C. Rank 2 Log-MAP The key step in rk2 Log-MAP without prior information is that Max-Log-MAP (MLM) approximation is applied assuming layer 0 to be the soft layer and the hard slicing of x1 is performed as in Equation (32) below: x ^ 1 \ue8a0 ( x 0 ) = argmin x 1 \u2208 \u2102 1 \ue89e \uf603 h 1 H \ue8a0 ( y - h 0 \ue89e x 0 ) - h 1 H \ue89e h 1 \ue89e x 1 \uf604 2 ( 32 ) Three options are possible: 1. The cross-layer x1 belongs to a non-uniform M-QAM constellation Sp,q (\u03c71, \u03c72) and soft layer \u03c70 belongs to a uniform M-QAM constellation. 2. The cross-layer x1 belongs to a uniform M-QAM constellation and soft layer \u03c70 belongs to a non-uniform M-QAM constellation Sp,q (\u03c71, \u03c72). 3. Both soft layer and cross layer belong to non-uniform M-QAM constellations Sp,q (\u03c71, \u03c72) and Sp,q (\u03c73, \u03c74), respectively. Compared to conventional slicers for uniform M-QAM constellations, the hard slicer proposed herein has modified decision boundaries to handle non-uniform M-QAM constellations. This can be handled as a special case of hard slicing with prior information. rk2 Log-MAP iterative detection is possible if the UE is provided sufficient information (e.g., MCS, Cell RNTI (C-RNTI), and any other possibly pertinent information) to decode the co-scheduled UE's physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) codeword. When iterative detection is possible, iterative (turbo) soft interference cancellation is possible. One of the key steps in rk2 Log-MAP without iterative detection is that the MLM approximation is applied assuming layer 0 to be the soft layer and the hard slicing of x1 is performed as in Equation (33)(a) below: x ^ 1 \ue8a0 ( x 0 ) = arg \ue89e \ue89e min x 1 \u2208 \ue89e \u2102 1 \ue89e ( \uf605 y - H \ue89e \ue89e x \uf606 2 - \u03c3 2 2 \ue89e \u2211 ( m , n ) \u2260 ( i , l ) \ue89e \ue89e ( - 1 ) b m , n \ue89e L a \ue8a0 ( b m , n ) ) ( 33 ) \ue89e ( a ) which is equivalent to Equation (33)(b) below: x ^ 1 \ue8a0 ( x 0 ) = arg \ue89e \ue89e min x 1 \u2208 \ue89e \u2102 1 \ue89e ( \uf605 y - H \ue89e \ue89e x \uf606 2 - \u03c3 2 2 \ue89e \u2211 n \ue89e \ue89e ( - 1 ) b 1 , n \ue89e L a \ue8a0 ( b 1 , n ) ) ( 33 ) \ue89e ( b ) V. Control Signaling for GNC The co-scheduled UEs according to embodiments of the present disclosure need to be informed of one or more of: 1) the type of superposition transmission (e.g., no MUST, 1-layer MUST, or multi-layer MUST), 2) the modulation orders for the constituent users that are co-scheduled, and 3) the power split factor \u03b1n=1\u2212\u03b1F on the precoding vector (or equivalently the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) antenna port) applicable to near/far user PDSCH symbols. Downlink Control Information (DCI) for Joint LLR or SLIC As discussed above, in some embodiments, the BS/eNB dynamically (i) decides whether or not MUST is employed; (ii) selects a user pair (or user triplet) and the corresponding MCS(s); and (iii) if MUST is employed, determines the suitable \u03b1N=1\u2212\u03b1F power split factor based on the MCS selected. In such embodiments, the needed pieces of information could be transmitted to the UEs as DCI over the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH)/enhanced physical downlink control channel (EPDCCH). In MUST schemes, the range of values of \u03b1N=1\u2212\u03b1F that is of interest is determined based on p,q values. Under the GNC definition, p=1 is always true since it is scaled out by the normalization factor as described above. Thus, the eNB only needs to signal one of (1) \u03b1N, (2) \u03b1F, and (3) q values. Once the modulation orders and the user ranks are indicated, and one of (1) \u03b1N, (2) \u03b1F, and (3) q values are provided, the receiving UE will be able to deduce the other parameters. When provided to the UE via control signaling, \u03b1N or \u03b1F can be selected from a small set of feasible values. For example, if system simulations determine that the relevant range for \u03b1F is \u03b1F a[0,2,1), this range set can be reduced to a finite alphabet set, such as, for example, [0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9], which includes the different ratios necessary to obtain the non-uniform Sp,q(\u03c71, \u03c72) constellations of interest. Similarly, the q value, when provided to the UE via control signaling, can be transmitted in DCI once again based on a finite alphabet. As discussed above, when \u03b1F enters a certain range, Gray mapping is violated and the BS/eNB scheduler may decide to use Direct Symbol Mapping (DSM) rather than GNC mapping. In such a scenario, the BS/eNB can send an indication in DCI to indicate whether it is using, in a given TTI, (1) GNC mapping without bit swapping; (2) GNC mapping with bit swapping; or (3) DSM. The UE can use this information to appropriately configure its detecting, decoding, and processing, based on the type of mapping used. In LTE Rel-12, DCI Format 2C has a three-bit field indicating \u201cantenna port(s), scrambling identity and number of layers\u201d. See, e.g., 3GPP TS 36.212, v. 12.0.0 (2013-12), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, \u00a75.3.3.1.5C. In addition, 3GPP TS 36.211 v. 12.5.0 (2015-03) is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. This three-bit field, which can thus take the values 0-7, indicates the messages as shown in Table 5 below, which is based on Table 5.3.3.1.5C-1 in TS 36.212: TABLE 5 DCI Format 2C \u201cAntenna port(s), . . .\u201d Field Values One Codeword: Two Codewords: Codeword 0 enabled, Codeword 0 enabled, Codeword 1 disabled Codeword 1 enabled value Message value Message 0 1 layer, port 7, nSCID = 0 0 2 layers, ports 7-8, nSCID = 0 1 1 layer, port 7, nSCID = 1 1 2 layers, ports 7-8, nSCID = 1 2 1 layer, port 8, nSCID = 0 2 3 layers, ports 7-9 3 1 layer, port 8, nSCID = 1 3 4 layers, ports 7-10 4 2 layers, ports 7-8 4 5 layers, ports 7-11 5 3 layers, ports 7-9 5 6 layers, ports 7-12 6 4 layers, ports 7-10 6 7 layers, ports 7-13 7 Reserved 7 8 layers, ports 7-14 Since MCS is independently controllable on ports 7 and 8 during 2 layer transmission and on ports 7/8 and 9/10 during 4 layer transmission, when MUST is employed (i.e., with two users), the possibilities are that: 1) in 1 layer transmission, the other user is co-scheduled on port 7; 2) in 2 layer transmission, the other user is co-scheduled on port 7 or port 7/8; 3) in 3 layer transmission, the other user is co-scheduled on port 7 or port 7/8 or port 7/8/9; and 4) in 4 layer transmission, the other user is co-scheduled on port 7 or port 7/8 or port 7/8/9 or port 7/8/9/10. Accordingly, the three-bit field indicating \u201cantenna port(s), . . . \u201d in DCI Format 2C already contains the information to convey the co-scheduled user transmission state and the number of transmission layers. One of the signaling states, such as, for example, the RESERVED message for field value=7 (for one codeword) can be used to indicate whether there is a MUST transmission. The above-described signalling is more general than what is needed for MUST Scenario 1 and MUST Scenario 2. In Table 5, nSCID allocation by the eNb is fully flexible for the user and the co-scheduled user. At least the modulation order(s) for the co-scheduled user's one or more layers also needs to be signaled by the eNb or blindly estimated by the UE. For example, up to two MCSs (which determine the modulation orders for up to 4 layers) can be indicated, but this is unnecessary for SLIC, which does not need to know the coding rates so the modulation order is enough. Instead, the two modulation orders (for up to 4 layers) can be directly signaled. Since there are 4 modulation orders in LTE Rel-12 {QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, 256QAM}, only 2 bits are needed to indicate the modulation order if it is signaled by the eNb. Accordingly, assuming K=2, a maximum of 2*2=4 bits are needed to indicate the co-scheduled user modulation on all of its layers. More generally, *2 bits are needed for each UE. In summary, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, the MUST control information which needs to be blindly estimated by the UE or signaled by, for example, DCI, should include: 1) a MUST or no MUST indication; 2) one of (i) \u03b1N, (ii) \u03b1F, and (iii) q values; 3) 1-bit indication whether GNC mapping or DSM is used in a TTI; 4) co-scheduled user's antenna port(s), scrambling identity, and number of layers indication; and 5) co-scheduled user's modulation order (pair) for SLIC or MCS (pair) indication for CWIC. Downlink Control Information (DCI) for CWIC If the near UE needs to be able to perform CWIC, the co-scheduled UE MCS/TB information needs to be signaled in DCI in addition to the information elements described above. In TS 36.212, for co-scheduled user transport block 1: Modulation and coding scheme\u20145 bits New data indicator\u20141 bit Redundancy version\u20142 bits In TS 36.212, for co-scheduled user transport block 2: Modulation and coding scheme\u20145 bits New data indicator\u20141 bit Redundancy version\u20142 bits The signal RNTI information (such as, for example, C-RNTI, and Semi-persistent C-RNTI (SPS-C-RNTI)) for the co-scheduled user can be signaled in DCI. However, this will likely lead to a large overhead. Instead the RNTI information and the associated co-scheduler user index can be indicated via radio resource control (RRC). The DCI can include a co-scheduled user index pointer, which points to the RNTI information sent ahead of time in RRC signaling.

    "patent_mail": "Subject: Important Details Regarding Our Patent on Superposition Constellations\n\nDear [Colleague's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to share some significant insights from our recent patent related to the selection of superposition constellations for communication systems, specifically focusing on the method of generating a Gray-mapped Non-uniform-capable Constellation (GNC) for multiple user equipment (UE) constellations.\n\n**Key Claims from the Patent:**\n\n1. **Method Overview:** The patent outlines a method for selecting a superposition constellation comprising two or more user equipment (UE) constellations. This involves determining the appropriate type of superposition constellation to generate based on the power ratios among the UEs. Notably, one type of super-constellation is defined as a GNC, where both constituent constellations and the GNC itself are Gray-mapped.\n\n2. **Decision Factors:** The method encompasses several decision-making processes:\n   - Whether to perform bit-swapping among the UEs.\n   - The selection criteria are influenced by parameters such as target throughput, Block Error Rate (BLER), Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), and the MIMO rank of the UEs.\n   - The determination may also involve consulting look-up tables (LUTs) to find the required constellation parameters.\n\n3. **Mapping Process:** For generating a GNC super-constellation, the mapping of symbols is done from the outermost bits to the innermost bits, specifically accommodating the QPSK modulation scheme used by the UEs. \n\n4. **Applications:** This technology finds its application in enhancing the efficiency of superposition multiple access communication technologies, which contributes significantly to the development of advanced communication systems.\n\n**Co-Authors:**\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of my co-authors on this patent:\n- John Doe (Employee ID: 1000)\n- Michael Snow (Employee ID: 2000)\n- Summer Winter (Employee ID: 3000)\n\nPlease ensure that this information is treated with the utmost confidentiality, as it is pertinent to our ongoing projects and future developments.\n\nShould you have any questions or require further clarification on specific aspects of the patent, feel free to reach out.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position]  \n[Your Company]  \n[Your Contact Information]  "
