FIELD OF THE INVENTION Embodiments of the invention generally relate to apparatuses and methods for vapor deposition, and more particularly, to chemical vapor deposition systems, reactors, and processes thereof. BACKGROUND ART Photovoltaic or solar devices, semiconductor devices, or other electronic devices are usually manufactured by utilizing a variety of fabrication processes to manipulate the surface of a substrate. These fabrication processes may include deposition, annealing, etching, doping, oxidation, nitridation, and many other processes. Epitaxial lift off (ELO) is a less common technique for fabricating thin film devices and materials in which layers of materials are deposited to and then removed from a growth substrate. An epitaxial layer, film, or material is grown or deposited on a sacrificial layer which is disposed on the growth substrate, such as a gallium arsenide wafer, by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process or a metallic-organic CVD (MOCVD) process. Subsequently, the sacrificial layer is selectively etched away in a wet acid bath, while the epitaxial material is separated from the growth substrate during the ELO etch process. The isolated epitaxial material may be a thin layer or film which is usually referred to as the ELO film or the epitaxial film. Each epitaxial film generally contains numerous layers of varying compositions relative to the specific device, such as photovoltaic or solar devices, semiconductor devices, or other electronic devices. The CVD process includes growing or depositing the epitaxial film by the reaction of vapor phase chemical precursors. During a MOCVD process, at least one of the chemical precursors is a metallic-organic compound\u2014that is\u2014a compound having a metal atom and at least one ligand containing an organic fragment. There are numerous types of CVD reactors for very different applications. For example, CVD reactors include single or bulk wafer reactors, atmospheric and low pressure reactors, ambient temperature and high temperature reactors, as well as plasma enhanced reactors. These distinct designs address a variety of challenges that are encountered during a CVD process, such as depletion effects, contamination issues, reactor maintenance, throughput, and production costs. Therefore, there is a need for CVD systems, reactors, and processes to grow epitaxial films and materials on substrates more effectively with less contamination, higher throughput, and less expensive than by currently known CVD equipment and processes.

In another embodiment, FIGS. 12A-12E depict levitating wafer carrier 480 which may be used to carry a substrate through a variety of processing chambers including the CVD reactors as described herein, as well as other processing chambers used for deposition or etching. Levitating wafer carrier 480 has short sides 471, long sides 473, an upper surface 472, and a lower surface 474. Levitating wafer carrier 480 is illustrated with a rectangular geometry, but may also have a square geometry, a circular geometry, or other geometries. Levitating wafer carrier 480 may contain or be formed from graphite or other materials. Levitating wafer carrier 480 usually travels through the CVD reactor with the short sides 471 facing forward while the long sides 473 face towards the sides of the CVD reactor. FIGS. 12A-12B depict levitating wafer carrier 480 according to one embodiment described herein. FIG. 12A illustrates a top view of levitating wafer carrier 480 containing 3 indentations 475 on the upper surface 472. Wafers or substrates may be positioned within the indentations 475 while being transferred through the CVD reactor during a process. Although illustrated with 3 indentations 475, the upper surface 472 may have more or less indentations, including no indentations. For example, the upper surface 472 of levitating wafer carrier 480 may contain 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, or more indentations for containing wafers or substrates. In some example, one wafer/substrate or multiple wafers/substrates may be disposed directly on the upper surface 472 which does not have an indentation. FIG. 12B illustrates a bottom view of levitating wafer carrier 480 containing the indentation 478 on the lower surface 474, as described in one embodiment herein. The indentation 478 may be used to help levitate levitating wafer carrier 480 upon the introduction of a gas cushion under levitating wafer carrier 480. A gas flow may be directed at the indentation 478, which accumulates gas to form the gas cushion. The lower surface 474 of levitating wafer carrier 480 may have no indentations, or may have one indentation 478 (FIG. 12B), two indentations 478 (FIGS. 12C-12E), three indentations 478 (not shown) or more. Each of the indentations 478 may have straight or tapered sides. In one example, each indentation 478 has tapered sides such that the sides 476 are steeper or more abrupt than the sides 477 which have more of a gradual change of angle. The sides 477 within the indentation 478 may be tapered to compensate for a thermal gradient across levitating wafer carrier 480. Also, the sides 477 may be tapered or angled to help form a gas pocket and to maintain the gas pocket under levitating wafer carrier 480 while lifting and moving/traversing levitating wafer carrier 480 along wafer carrier track 400. In another example, the indentation 478 has straight or substantially straight sides and tapered sides such that the sides 476 are straight or substantially straight and the sides 477 have a taper/angle or the sides 477 are straight or substantially straight and the sides 476 have a taper/angle. Alternatively, the indentation 478 may have all straight sides such that the sides 476 and 477 are straight or substantially straight. In another embodiment, FIGS. 12C-12E illustrate bottom views of levitating wafer carrier 480 containing two indentations 478 on the lower surface 474. The two indentations 478 help levitate levitating wafer carrier 480 upon the introduction of a gas cushion under levitating wafer carrier 480. A gas flow may be directed at the indentations 478, which accumulates gas to form the gas cushion. The indentations 478 may have straight or tapered sides. In one example, as illustrated in FIG. 10E, the indentations 478 have all straight sides such that the sides 476 and 477 are straight, e.g., perpendicular to the plane of the lower surface 474. In another example, as illustrated in FIG. 10F, the indentations 478 have all tapered sides such that the sides 476 are steeper or more abrupt than the sides 477 which have more of a gradual change of angle. The sides 477 within the indentations 478 may be tapered to compensate for a thermal gradient across levitating wafer carrier 480. Alternatively, the indentations 478 may have a combination of straight sides and tapered sides such that the sides 476 are straight and the sides 477 have a taper or the sides 477 are straight and the sides 476 have a taper. Levitating wafer carrier 480 contains a heat flux which extends from the lower surface 474 to the upper surface 472 and to any substrates disposed thereon. The heat flux may be controlled by both the internal pressure and length of the processing system. The profile of levitating wafer carrier 480 may be tapered to compensate the heat loses from other sources. During a process, heat is lost through the edges of levitating wafer carrier 480, such as the short sides 471 and the long sides 473. However, the heat lost may be compensated by allowing more heat flux into the edges of levitating wafer carrier 480 by reducing the gap of the channel in the levitation. In another embodiment, wafer carrier track 400 contains levitating wafer carrier 480 disposed on guide path 420. In some examples, levitating wafer carrier 480 has at least one indentation pocket disposed within a lower surface. In other examples, levitating wafer carrier 480 has at least two indentation pockets disposed within a lower surface.

Each of the gas tubes 580 extends parallel or substantially parallel to each other as well as to central axis 501 in many embodiments described herein. In an alternative embodiment, not shown, each of the gas tubes 580 may extend at a predetermined angle relative to central axis 501, such as within a range from about 1\u00b0 to about 15\u00b0 or greater. Isolator assembly 500 may be used to disperse gases, such as purge gases, precursor gases, and/or carrier gases, by providing a flow path through inlet port 522 and into cavities 538, 548, and 558. Cavity 538 is formed between upper plate 520 and diffusion plate 530 within centralized channel 516.
